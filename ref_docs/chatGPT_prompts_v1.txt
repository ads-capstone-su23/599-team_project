Prompt 1: Create Dataframe of files
I have 3 local folders ("\Programming\Python and R\ADS Markdown Files\ADS-599 Local\data\celeb-df-v2\Celeb-real", "\Programming\Python and R\ADS Markdown Files\ADS-599 Local\data\celeb-df-v2\Celeb-synthesis", "\Programming\Python and R\ADS Markdown Files\ADS-599 Local\data\celeb-df-v2\YouTube-real") that contain videos that I need to perform a series of tasks for in Python on a Windows machine:
1. Create a pandas dataframe called “images” with columns for "main folder", “folder name”, “file name”.
2. Print the shape of the dataframe.
3. Display the first 11 records of the dataframe.

Prompt 2: Ingest and process data
I have a dataframe ("train_df") with the names of file paths, including the parent directory, folder name, and file name. Each record represents a video of variable length and size. Provide a python function to upload the videos using OpenCV and preprocess them to get them into a numpy array or dataframe that can be read by tensorflow or pytorch.
1. Determine the number of frames the shortest and longest videos, as well as the median number of frames for all videos.
2. Determine the height and width of largest and smallest images, as well as the median height and width for all videos.
3. Use "train_df" to pass in individual videos and convert them to a dataframe of static image data, with batch dimension for each video.
4. Process each image in the following manner:
a. Set to a specified heigth and width (e.g., 120x120).
b. Set a maximum number of frames (e.g., median achieved from step 1)
c. Padding those videos that are shorter than the maximum.
d. Convert all images to gray scale.
e. Extract features using wavelet transfrom.
f. Return a numpy array in the dimensions readable by tensorflow for convolutional neural network.
