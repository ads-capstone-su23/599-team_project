      "Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, two of the world’s leading tech billionaires, recently engaged in a humorous social media exchange about a potential cage fight. Zuckerberg has been training in mixed martial arts for some time now, it is unclear if Musk has any combat experience whatsoever. When Musk proposed a match, Zuck responded, “Send me location.”\n",
      "BBC News reports that Elon Musk, the owner of Twitter and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, and Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook (now known as Meta), have seemingly agreed to compete in a cage fight after engaging in a surprising Twitter conversation. The back and forth, which has since gone viral, started when Musk said he was “up for a cage fight” with Zuckerberg in a tweet. Zuckerberg replied by sharing a screenshot of Musk’s tweet along with the request, “Send me location.” While Musk was likely living up to the billing given to him by Donald Trump as a “bullshit artist,” signs point to Zuckerberg being more serious.\n",

      "Musk continued to make fun of the fight by jokingly suggesting that it take place in the UFC Octagon in Las Vegas, using the phrase “Vegas Octagon.” In another amusing tweet, he described a move he calls “The Walrus,” in which he would “just lie on top of my opponent & do nothing.” He then provided a few walrus-related videos as a hint that his challenge might not be entirely serious.\n",
      "“I have this great move that I call ‘The Walrus’, where I just lie on top of my opponent & do nothing,” Musk tweeted.\n",
      "Users of social media have eagerly joined in the fun, speculating about who would triumph in the match, and making memes and parody posters to promote the fight.\n",

      "FAMM advocates for soft-on-crime policies such as ending mandatory minimum sentencing, increasing the minimum threshold for selling crack cocaine, and removing fentanyl from Schedule I.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The group wrote about why they oppose mandatory minimums:\n",
      "Mandatory minimum sentences are not necessary to ensure sufficient punishment – and actually create unjust, excessive results that make us less safe. Eliminating mandatory minimum sentences does not mean that people will not be punished or imprisoned – it means courts won’t have to imprison people indiscriminately, without considering factors that matter. Mandatory minimum sentences require courts to send people to prison even if prison is unnecessary to keep the public safe, or keep people in prison past the point at which they pose a danger to others. Mandatory minimum sentences deny courts the ability to use more cost-effective alternatives to incarceration, like drug or mental health court programs. Mandatory minimum sentences make the public less safe by wasting expensive prison resources on the wrong people – money that can’t be spent preventing crime.\n",
      "FAMM wants to make the threshold for selling crack cocaine equal to that of powder cocaine, alleging the disparity between the two is “racially discriminatory:”\n",
      "Crack cocaine and powder cocaine are two forms of the same drug. Despite this, under federal law we impose the same harsh penalties for the possession of one amount of crack cocaine and an amount of powder cocaine that is 18 times larger. This makes it much easier to trigger a mandatory minimum for sale of crack cocaine than if the same offense were committed with powder cocaine. This disparity is not based in science and has a racially discriminatory impact. Congress should eliminate the disparity and apply the reform retroactively so all people get fair sentences.\n",
      "FAMM also opposes H.R. 467, the HALT Fentanyl Act, a bill that would “permanently schedule fentanyl related substances on schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act (meaning it has a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical value).”\n",
      "The HALT Fentanyl Act passed through the House in late May on a strong bipartisan basis.\n",
      "FAMM also receives funding from George Soros.\n",
      "\n",
      "FAMM is a nonpartisan organization that has had significant success in bringing people from across the ideological spectrum together on sentencing and prison reform,” a press release from 2016 states, “It receives funding from both the Koch Brothers and George Soros, for example.”\n",
      "Casey’s office met with FAMM as crime in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has spiked.\n",
      "When Casey announced his reelection campaign in April, David McCormick, a likely Senate Republican candidate, slammed Casey for doing “nothing to fight crime.”\n",
      "He said:\n",
      "Bob Casey votes for Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer’s failing, far-left agenda 100% of the time. Thanks to Casey’s support for open borders, 5,000 Pennsylvanians lost their lives to fentanyl in 2020 alone. Pennsylvania is the second biggest gas-producing state in the country, yet Casey’s support for leftist energy policies has cost our state thousands of jobs. And even though Philadelphia has one of the highest murder rates in the country, Casey has done nothing to fight crime and instead has supported dangerous policies. A vote for Casey is a vote for Biden and Schumer — he’s a Washington insider and not a leader we can count on to deliver a better future for our great commonwealth.\n",

      "Over five months after Julian Sands went missing during a solo hike in California, local police have announced the ongoing search for the actor will continue in a \"limited capacity.\"The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Office released a statement Monday on the department's continued efforts to locate the \"A Room with a View\" actor.Sands, 65, was reported missing on Jan. 13 while hiking a trail on Mount Baldy in Southern California, San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Gloria Huerta said at the time. Authorities' search efforts, both on the ground and by air, have been paused and resumed based on a series of storms that has created dangerous mountain conditions in the area.On Saturday, the sheriff's office conducted another search for Sands involving over 80 search and rescue volunteers, deputies and staff. Two helicopters helped search teams reach remote areas of Mount Baldy, and drone crews searched areas inaccessible to hikers on the ground.Despite the department's efforts, Sands was still not found. Some areas of the mountain \"remain inaccessible due to extreme alpine conditions,\" the statement explained. \"Multiple areas include steep terrain and ravines, which still have 10 plus feet of ice and snow.\"While Sands' missing person case remains \"active,\" \"search efforts will continue in a limited capacity,\" the department said. The sheriff's department has conducted eight searches, including both ground and air, to locate the actor since he went missing in January, logging over 500 volunteer searcher hours.Sands' family has expressed gratitude to authorities for their \"heroic\" search efforts.\"Our heartfelt thanks to the compassionate members of the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department who are coordinating the search for our beloved Julian,\" the actor's family said in a statement in late January. \"We are deeply touched by the outpouring of love and support.”Sands starred opposite Helena Bonham Carter in \"A Room With a View,\" the 1985 British romance from director James Ivory.

But for queer couples, the expenses accrue long before a baby is born. Whether it's IUI, IVF, reciprocal IVF, surrogacy, or adoption, all paths to parenthood are a major financial decision. And for trans lesbians, there also may be additional costs and considerations.While infertility insurance law is starting to catch up to include the needs of LGBTQ+ people, we still have a way to go. In most instances, lesbian couples have to pay for everything out of pocket.Jess Dinney and her wife, who live in Florida, spent $30,000 on two IUI attempts and two IVF transfers. The procedure paid off for Dinney and her wife, who welcomed twins.Dinney, however, had to rely on debt to make their dreams possible.\"We had several conversations about what we were willing to spend, but in my heart, I knew there was no limit. Our insurance didn't cover any of the fertility treatment costs and, although it was a heavy financial burden, not having a biological child is something I would've regretted more,\" she said.As I slowly put together the puzzle pieces of parenthood, one question remains unanswered: At what point does my dream of being a mother become financially irresponsible?The hardest part about coming out wasn't accepting my sexuality — it was grieving the version of motherhood I had long imagined.

If it's the higher-earning spouse, what changes are required to financially make it work? Is there an agreed spending ceiling? Is there a plan B and C?Fish advises having these conversations as early as possible.

After a year of trying to conceive, it was the first and last IVF attempt.She said the financial burden compounded the further along they got in the journey. Having a cash reserve and self-funded maternity leave helped, and they were able to take time off when Swikard gave birth to their boy.They continue to pay a monthly fee to store an embryo and sperm (from the same donor), in the event they choose to have another child.Swikard said there's an element of relationship building for the non-birthing partner, so having a fluid stay-at-home role is critical. \"I love that we both were able to carry in the end.

      "Democratic lawmakers quickly condemned the Supreme Court's Friday morning decision invalidating President Joe Biden's student-loan forgiveness plan that would have cancelled more than $400 billion in student debt for tens of millions of borrowers.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the decision by the \"the MAGA Republican-controlled\" high court \"disappointing and cruel\" and urged the Biden administration to continue fighting for debt relief. \"The fight will not end here,\" he tweeted. \"The Biden administration has remaining legal routes to provide broad-based student debt cancellation.\"Biden's plan, announced at the end of August, would have cancelled up to $20,000 in student debt for federal borrowers who are Pell Grant recipients making under $125,000 a year, and up to $10,000 in student debt for other federal borrowers under the same income cap.The Supreme Court decision came in two separate rulings on Friday. The high court ruled that the plaintiffs in one case, US Department of Education v. Brown, did not have standing — but the second case, Biden v. Nebraska, prevailed and the six GOP-led states had standing to sue on behalf of student-loan company, MOHELA.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and outspoken proponent of student-debt cancellation, called on the Biden administration to \"throw everything they've got into the fight\" to ensure \"more than 40 million hard working Americans\" get the relief the president promised.\"The same Supreme Court that overturned Roe now refuses to follow the plain language of the law on student loan cancellation. This fight is not over. The President has more tools to cancel student debt — and he must use them,\" Warren tweeted on Friday morning.Rep. Barbara Lee, a California Democrat, noted that student debt disproportionately impacts Black and brown Americans, tweeting, \"we cannot accept a return to the failed status quo.\"\"I raised 2 sons & put them through college as a single mom. I know firsthand how the burden of student loan debt can impact a person's life,\" she said. CNN reported on Friday morning that Biden \"plans to announce new actions to protect student loan borrowers\" during a speech later in the day, according to a source familiar. \n",

      "Walgreens Boots Alliance on Tuesday reported earnings that tumbled from the same time a year ago amid softening consumer spending and a pullback in demand for Covid vaccines. The pharmacy chain posted earnings for its fiscal third quarter of $118 million, or 14 cents a share, compared to $289 million, or 33 cents a share a year ago. Shares of the company fell close to 10% Tuesday. The company also slashed its full-year guidance to $4.00 to $4.05 a share from $4.45 to $4.65 previously, citing “challenging consumer and macroeconomic conditions, and lower COVID-19 vaccine and testing volumes.” “Our revised guidance takes an appropriately cautious forward view in light of consumer spending uncertainty, while still demonstrating clear drivers of a return to operating growth next fiscal year,” CEO Rosalind Brewer, said in a statement.

      "            \n",
      "                (WBA) to drive sustainable core growth and deliver long-term shareholder value.” The company said its retail pharmacy sales in the US came in at $27.9 billion, up 4.4% from a year ago and comparable sales (or sales at stores open at least a year) for the segment were up 7% compared to a year ago.  Its pharmacy sales increased 6.3% in the period versus a year ago, while comparable pharmacy sales increased 9.8%, boosted by higher prices of branded medication. But the volume of Covid vaccines administered in the quarter plummeted to 0.8 million, compared to 4.7 million a year ago. The retailer also noted softer sales of over-the-counter testing kits in the quarter. Outside of pharmacy products, Walgreens reported retail sales fell 1% and comparable sales decreased 0.2% in the quarter. Excluding tobacco, comparable retail sales increased 0.2%, led by purchases of grocery, household and beauty items.  Walgreens is also experimenting with newer store formats, including one in Chicago where most of the merchandise is intentionally kept out of sight. The store, located on 2 East Roosevelt Road, at one point offered a typical Walgreens shopping experience – multiple aisles stacked with daily essentials, cosmetics, packaged snacks, health care needs and an in-store pharmacy. The same location earlier this month reopened with a dramatically pared back look. Walgreens says it’s a digital-first experimental store to benefit customers. It’s not designed to deter theft, Walgreens says. But retail experts say keeping all merchandise out of reach sure is an effective way to combat rising incidents of shoplifting. Retail analyst Neil Saunders, managing director at Global Data, called the store an “extremely unfriendly, utilitarian concept that has been informed by the needs of Walgreens to reduce theft and labor costs rather than by serving customers.” “Our research and visits to the store reveal a lackluster reception from both shoppers and staff,” said Saunders in a note Tuesday. \n",

      "In between leading Sunday services at All Saints’ Cathedral in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, Rev. Canon John Awodi declares vehemently that “homosexuality is a sin that must be repented of,” adding that it is against the “order of God.” “Homosexuality is not natural, it is unnatural. That is the stand of the church here. It is unbiblical, it is unnatural,” the Anglican cleric told CNN. These themes have become a common thread in his sermons and interviews, especially since Uganda’s Anti-Homosexuality Act was signed into law last month. The act outlaws gay marriage in Uganda, punishes same-sex acts with life imprisonment, and calls for the death penalty for “aggravated homosexuality” – which includes sex with a minor or otherwise vulnerable person, having sex while HIV positive and incest. After initially wavering and sending the bill – which is widely popular with lawmakers, Christian and Muslim leaders in Uganda, as well as commentators on social media  – back to parliament for review, President Yoweri Museveni eventually signed it into law in May, leading to global criticism, existential dread within the LGBTQ+ community, and legal challenges. ‘Nowhere is safe’ “It dehumanizes us as human beings, it doesn’t treat us as citizens. We are literally criminals and we are illegal in our own space that we call home. Nowhere is safe for any queer person living in Uganda,” Joan Amek, co-founder of Rella Women’s Foundation, told CNN.  Even though she created a safe space and shelter for lesbian, bisexual, and queer women through her organization, she says, she herself faces eviction from her rented apartment by the end of July. She believes it is because of her sexuality and prominence in queer activism, even though her landlord didn’t explicitly say so but her suspicions rose after a neighbor tipped her off. “I have had myself being chased away from where I’m staying,” she said.  Returning to her parents’ house was not an option either. “My mum stands in solidarity with me but from a distance. When we had the conversation that I had been evicted, she didn’t say ‘you can come home’ she just said ‘oh, sorry, I’ll pray for you.’ How is prayer going to help?” Amek asked.  In recent weeks, disturbing videos have surfaced showing mounting hostility towards lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex individuals in Uganda since the reintroduction of the Anti-Homosexuality Bill.  In one video, verified by a consortium of civil society groups called the Strategic Response Team (SRT), a transgender woman is marched naked on the streets while a jeering crowd follows, and a lesbian couple endures ridicule from neighbors, among other forms of public shaming. At least 300 human rights violations against suspected homosexuals have been reported in Uganda arising from the Anti-Homosexuality Act of 2023, the SRT told CNN. As it investigates them, the SRT says it submitted a list of 50 verified cases to a judge while seeking an injunction against the law.  They include cases of evictions, so-called “corrective” rape, outing, termination from employment, blackmail, threats of violence or physical attacks and incidents of mob justice, according to SRT. However, opposition lawmaker Asuman Basalirwa, who introduced the 2023 bill, dismissed the latest reports of human rights violations as “distortions” and fabrications.  He told CNN the allegations were “completely false,” and backed the law. “Who has been fired from their jobs? Who has been evicted from their houses? This is a very innocent law. No one has been targeted,” he said. ‘My life is hell’ Nash Wash Raphael, a 30-year-old transgender man, says he was attacked on the night Museveni signed the Anti-Homosexuality Act. He was left with a broken ankle and relies on crutches to walk while it heals. This was not the first time Raphael had faced violence; he says it was the ninth assault since his transition. Raphael describes his life as “hell,” and says he attempted suicide when pictures of him and his partner were leaked and went viral. While they weren’t intimate photos, they still outed him.  “I feel like I should take my own life as there is nothing else I’m left to protect. This is my second year on hormones, and I was supposed to get my top surgery next year, but all this has been shattered, and I can’t even afford it,” Raphael said. Top surgery refers to the procedure to remove breast or chest tissue. Raphael says he no longer walks during the day, afraid that he might get attacked again.  After getting fired from his job for not wearing traditional women’s clothes, he tried casual jobs in Dubai and Saudi Arabia and hawking baked goods in Kampala but says he couldn’t keep his identity hidden for long.  He says his Muslim family disowned him and he remains in contact only with his youngest sister out of six siblings. His father told CNN that Raphael is his daughter who has refused to come home.  “My life is actually useless to them. I literally tell myself that I don’t have a family in this world. The same God that created them has a reason why he made me the way I am,” Raphael says, his voice breaking.  ‘Promoting’ homosexuality penalized The new law states that “a person who promotes homosexuality commits an offense and is liable, on conviction, to imprisonment for a period not exceeding twenty years.”  It also requires Ugandans to report suspected homosexuals or violations of the law to the authorities.  On Museveni’s recommendation, the law prescribes rehabilitation for convicted homosexuals to change their sexual orientation, even though scientists say so-called conversion therapy is harmful and ineffective.  Ugandan lawmakers, who overwhelmingly supported the bill, railed against the supposed “recruitment” of young people into homosexuality, pedophilia and grooming.  Basalirwa, the lawmaker, told CNN he had met with people who had been “recruited” but had, in his words, “counseled out of it.”  “I want to disagree with the people who say homosexuality is a Western concept. No, it is not. We’ve lived with homosexuality here in this country, in Africa. What is foreign is recruitment and promotion. That’s un-African,” he said.  Human rights  advocates say that the offense of “promotion” of homosexuality could be weaponized against activists, journalists, or any ordinary citizen.  “Someone can accuse anyone of being queer and they’ll get arrested. And next thing you know, you could be spending up to life in prison,” Amek told CNN. Cutting ties with the Anglican Church  Amek has grown accustomed to the dangers of her work, after she says her organization’s offices were raided by police three times, forcing them to move to a new shelter for vulnerable queer women.  It is the cost of continuing to operate in a conservative Ugandan society where homophobic messaging emanates everywhere from churches and mosques to the highest political offices, Amek said.  The Church of Uganda openly defied the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, and supported the Anti-Homosexuality Act, accusing the global head of the Anglican Church of misinterpreting the Bible. Welby wrote to the leader of Ugandan Anglicans expressing his “grief and dismay” for at that support, but it fell on deaf ears. The Church of Uganda says it will separate from the Church of England over their differences on the issue of homosexuality. The Anti-Homosexuality Act of 2023 is a revival of a previous version nicknamed the “Kill the Gays” Bill that Uganda’s parliament passed in 2014 but which was blocked in court on a technicality. This current law is also being challenged in court. Amek understands that she risks jail time by speaking up, but she persists, saying it is worth it. “I don’t want to be a martyr and die. But I want to stand strong for protection of the LGBTIQ generation and community now, but also for the future,” she said. “Silence equals death. And regardless of whether I stay silent or not, they’ll still kill us, they’ll still criminalize us.” \n",

      "Rolling Stone recently uncovered a juicy data point for understanding Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s odd political coalition: A super PAC called “Heal the Divide” intended to support his candidacy was created by a MAGA-aligned political consultancy based in Georgia. In fact, the magazine says it found that, until recently, the terms of service for the super PAC referred to the Heal the Divide site as “MAGApac.com,” which suggests that those words were carelessly copied and pasted from the website for that Trump-aligned political action committee. Rolling Stone reports that RTA Strategies, the political consultancy that created the “Heal the Divide” super PAC, has worked for MAGA superstar Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Trump ally Herschel Walker, who last year lost his race for Senate in Georgia. The operators behind RTA have also recently signed up to work for Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., as he navigates a seemingly unending series of political and legal crises. A political consultancy that usually works with right-wing politicians supporting Kennedy may be the clearest sign yet that it’s chiefly the right and not the left that views him as a weapon against President Joe Biden. There are many on the right who believe that Kennedy (who has occasionally reached support as high as 20% among  Democratic voters) could make Biden look like a weak incumbent ahead of the 2024 general election. This has anti-Trump Republican activists worried: “RFK and his candidacy are nothing but a Trojan horse to weaken Biden’s candidacy,” the Lincoln Project tweeted over the weekend when sharing the Rolling Stone report. But the Trojan horse metaphor gets it wrong. The right’s embrace of Kennedy is not a secret plot. Right-wing activists and media outlets are openly buzzing about Kennedy. And that’s because they don’t just think of him as a candidate who might confuse unsuspecting Democrats; they also like him. And can’t stop saying so. That, in turn, makes Kennedy less likely to be a covert chaos agent and more likely to code as someone who doesn’t belong in the Democratic primaries. Kennedy is a regular on the right-wing and right-friendly independent media and activist scene. He's appeared on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon’s podcast and Joe Rogan’s podcast. Right-wing venture capitalist David Sacks held a fundraiser for Kennedy last week, and Kennedy will be speaking at the annual summit for the right-wing activist group Moms for Liberty this week. Twitter founder and former CEO  Jack Dorsey, who leans libertarian, has enthusiastically endorsed his candidacy. Elon Musk has given him special attention through a Twitter Spaces interview.  Kennedy isn’t the passive or unwitting recipient of attention from these folks. He’s participating — and discussing ideas they support. Large swaths of the right find much to like about Kennedy’s views on opposing vaccines, opposing Covid safety measures, opposing U.S. involvement in the war in Ukraine, criticizing the CIA (which, without evidence, he claims assassinated President John F. Kennedy, who was his uncle, and assassinated his father, Robert F. Kennedy, a former attorney general and 1968 presidential candidate).  Infowars host Alex Jones, whose entire media personality revolves around outlandish conspiracy theories, said in April: “I don’t agree with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on some topics, but he’s a man of integrity that fights fluoride and poison shots and fentanyl and everything else. He’s a good man.” He added: “He’s got a lot of guts, and I really support him for the Democratic nomination.” Kennedy has not repudiated support from the right. He has said, \"I’ll talk to anybody,\" and is voluntarily showing up on these platforms. (He told The Atlantic he believes 2024 “will be decided by podcasts.”) At the same time, he appeared upset over the Rolling Stone reporting on the super PAC, tweeting after the article published: \"Expect Rolling Stone to lead the corporate media’s frantic crusade to vilify me to stop my White House bid.\" Does the right want to hurt Biden’s chances of winning?  Yes.  Are they going about backing Kennedy purely through covert dark money operations?  No. This is an open alliance.  If Kennedy were a third-party candidate, then things could get messy. He could plausibly draw defectors from the Democratic and Republican parties. But Kennedy insists consistently that he’s a Democrat, suggesting that his candidacy would end if he lost the Democratic primary. And his chances of winning there are not good when his most vocal constituency is made up of people who don’t even vote in those primaries. More substantively, the precise things that make him exciting to people on the right are likely to alienate the Democratic base. Democratic voters are unlikely to trust someone who believes Anthony Fauci is a fascist and promises to gut the Food and Drug Administration. It’s highly likely that Kennedy’s dynastic name is helping him overperform in early polling; if voters learn more about his views — and the right’s zealous embrace of him for that reason — those numbers are likely to plateau or drop.  Bannon and his ilk might view Kennedy as a weapon. But it’s precisely because they actually like him that that weapon is likely to misfire. \n",

      "The point of the federal ethics law known as the Hatch Act is relatively straightforward: Executive branch officials, whose salaries are paid by taxpayers, should avoid intervening in partisan politics. The law is designed to build a wall between official and political duties — and those walls have prevented abuses for decades. As regular readers might recall, Donald Trump and his White House team simply obliterated the wall and decided that the rules didn’t apply to them. In fact, in 2021, the Office of Special Counsel identified 13 senior White House officials who effectively treated the Hatch Act like a punchline. Some aides freely admitted that they simply didn’t care about the law. There were no meaningful consequences — it was up to Trump to hold his team accountable when confronted with evidence of lapses, and that obviously wasn’t going to happen — but the evidence was a reminder about the Republican operation’s indifference to ethical limits. It was against this backdrop that, in a bit of a surprise, the Biden White House faced a similar finding. NBC News reported last week: “Because Ms. Jean‐Pierre made the statements while acting in her official capacity, she violated the Hatch Act prohibition against using her official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election,” Ana Galindo‐Marrone, who leads the agency’s Hatch Act Unit, wrote. I’m all for consistency. I marveled at Team Trump’s wholesale indifference to the Hatch Act during the Republican’s tenure, so it’s tough to argue that it doesn’t matter when Team Biden runs afoul of the same ethics law. But I’m also mindful of the relevance of context and details. The Trump White House, for example, brazenly turned officials into political operatives. Richard Painter, who served as the chief White House ethics lawyer in the Bush/Cheney White House, described Team Trump’s transgressions as “disgusting” and “unprecedented in the history of the Hatch Act.” Painter added that the entire Trump administration, at the most senior levels, was “devoted to illegally using federal offices to promote the president’s political campaign.” In contrast, Karine Jean-Pierre referred to “mega MAGA Republicans,” effectively describing a contingent with a major political party. Those aren’t exactly equivalent violations. USA Today reported last week, “The White House is continuing to use the term ‘MAGA’ to label Republican opposition despite a federal watchdog agency’s warning that the language is a violation of the Hatch Act.” Look, I care about ethics laws, and I believe they should be followed. I also care about common sense: If Trump and his allies routinely make references to “MAGA” as if it were a proper political movement within the Republican Party, is it really an ethics violation if White House officials do the same thing?  \n",

      "'Rage giving' prompted by the end of Roe has dropped off, abortion access groups sayThe windfall of donations that abortion access groups received following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade one year ago hasn't lastedByTHALIA BEATY and GLENN GAMBOA Associated PressJune 24, 2023, 3:10 AMFILE - Abortion-rights activists protest outside the Supreme Court in Washington, Saturday, June 25, 2022. Abortion access groups who received a windfall of donations following the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade one year ago say those emergency grants have ended and individual and foundation giving has dropped off. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)The Associated PressThe “ rage giving ” did not last. Abortion access groups who received a windfall of donations following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade one year ago say those emergency grants have ended and individual and foundation giving has dropped off. After the Dobbs decision, some major funders of abortion access also have ended or shifted funding from organizations working in states where abortion is now banned, said Naa Amissah-Hammond, senior director of grantmaking with Groundswell Fund, which funds grassroots groups organizing for reproductive justice.Women’s health and foster care nonprofits, who expected increased demand in areas where access to abortion has been eliminated or restricted, say they also haven’t seen increased support.Holly Calvasina said her experience as director of development at the reproductive health clinic CHOICES in Memphis, Tennessee, might provide an explanation. Like many working in the reproductive rights sector, Calvasina said she tried to prepare for the increase in need, even before a draft of the Supreme Court decision was leaked in May last year. While some funders saw the writing on the wall and stepped up support, others wanted to wait and see. \"I think (that) really speaks to kind of a fundamental issue with philanthropy and responding to an emergent crisis,\" Calvasina said. \"Philanthropy moves really slowly and human rights crises unfold quickly.” The rollercoaster of giving also showed up for CHOICES in the $150,000 in donations to their annual spring appeal last year. That’s up from $2,000 in 2021. This year, the appeal raised $40,000. Organizations in states where abortion has been banned or limited have needed to pivot, said Marsha Jones, executive director of The Afiya Center, based in Dallas. Her organization used donations received after the Dobbs decision to expand its birthing center, but she said funders are less interested in supporting maternal health than they were in supporting advocacy and practical support for abortions. She argues, as she has for years, that supporting reproductive justice is more than supporting abortion access.“It is literally people wanting to choose full bodily autonomy,\" she said of those choosing to carry a pregnancy to term and others who do not. Data on last year's charitable giving to any sector is hard to come by. The pandemic has slowed the public release of donor reports to the IRS, though a delay of up to two years was typical even before COVID-19 hit. Donations to human services and public society benefit organizations, sectors that could include abortion access nonprofits, both declined in 2022, while donations to health organizations increased 5%, which is actually a decline when adjusted for inflation, according to the Giving USA report released last week.But a special layer of opacity exists around funding for abortion access. Many donors fund anonymously, sometimes requiring grantees not to publicly disclose the source. The largest historic funder, The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, eventually makes gifts public through tax filings, but the organization does not comment on support for abortion access and did not respond to questions about whether or how its funding strategy changed in response to the Dobbs decision. Another large funder, The David and Lucile Packard Foundation, said it is shifting its grantmaking after Dobbs. It stopped funding sex education programs in schools and ended funding for abortion services that closed due to new laws. The foundation also added $14.1 million in funding last year to “shore up providers in safe haven states,” and to help people find and access abortion care.The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation said it provides steady support to grantees in all states to fund abortion care where it remains legal or advocacy against bans.In general, giving to organizations specifically serving women and girls represents less than 2% of all donations, according to a research project of the Women’s Philanthropy Institute at Indiana University’s Lilly Family School of Philanthropy.Calvasina thinks anonymous funding, especially from the largest foundations, perpetuates inequality within the movement. Others in the sector said donors have many reasons for wanting to be anonymous, including to avoid being targeted by groups opposing abortion. One measure of the potential amount of funding available to reproductive health organizations is the extent of gifts from donor-advised funds hosted by the Silicon Valley Community Foundation to Planned Parenthood affiliates across the country. Those donations exceeded $98 million in 2022, according to data from Candid, a nonprofit that compiles information about charitable giving. The foundation declined to speak about the gifts, citing its policy not to comment on DAF grants. Seeing a drop in giving after a major event is not that unusual, said Una Osili, associate dean for research and international programs at the Lilly Family School.“If you think about the decision to give, whether it’s to a natural disaster or crisis, people hear about it and they want to participate to make a difference,” Osili said. Danielle Gletow, founder and executive director at One Simple Wish, a nonprofit connecting donors with foster children who have specific requests, said people are seeking out groups like hers offering direct support. But she worries that abortion access restrictions may further strain the foster care system. In Texas, where the state's child welfare program is so overwhelmed that children sometimes sleep in office buildings, foster care workers fear the state's strict laws on abortion may force women to have children for whom they cannot care, adding to the foster children population.“I don’t think it’s possible to break anything worse when it’s already broken, if I’m being honest,” Gletow said. “This is a system that’s incredibly broken.”Philanthropic support has surged to states such as New Mexico, which passed laws protecting access to abortion and shielding abortion providers while bordering Texas and Oklahoma, where abortion is now banned. A coalition of local groups publicly asked incoming funders and groups to coordinate with them as recently as February.Charlene Bencomo, executive director of Bold Futures, a leader of the coalition, said they ask new providers to accept Medicaid, which can cover abortion in the state, and to offer reproductive health services outside of abortion care.“We continue to look for a higher quality of care, a better quality of care for our folks in New Mexico and for those who need to come here to access care that they cannot in their home state,” Bencomo said. Amissah-Hammond, of the Groundswell Fund, said she's waiting to see if funders who responded with emergency or one-time grants last year will continue to fund abortion access over the long term. For funders concerned about legal liabilities, she suggested they offer general operating support, rather than project-based grants, and accept updates over the phone. “We’re learning a lot from our peer funders who have been funding in global contexts,\" she said. \"Where work for reproductive rights, health and justice has been criminalized for a long time and where LGBTQ rights has been criminalized and work, frankly, for democracy has been criminalized.” ___Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

I've never been great about sunscreen, but I was not going to let my daughter get burned. We live in South Florida and just a walk or park time is a potential burning hazard. This is a great visual for me to reapply her sunscreen or make sure she gets in the shade.

Now you can finally wear shorts or dresses without worrying about the inevitable inner thigh chafing (and the pain that accompanies it).Ciera Velarde / BuzzFeedI've used it for about 12 years now and it's the only thing that I can trust to prevent that dreaded chafing after a sweaty day of walking around. It glides on perfectly, it's unscented, and it doesn't melt away when you start to sweat. If it's a particularly hot day out, it can start to fade after a few hours, so just make sure to bring it with you to reapply. In addition to preventing chafing between my thighs, I've also applied it on my arms where my sports bra rubs against them when I run and it works like a charm!Promising review: \"I just used it for five days in 90 degree plus weather at Bonnaroo music festival in the middle of Tennessee on a farm in June with 100,000 people walking several miles, dancing, and sweating every day. I am happy to report that this product is a lifesaver. My thighs didn't chafe once, and I have big ones! I had to reapply once during the day.

Place these on any potential problem spots before heading out on an adventure and you can say goodbye to that awful blister-causing friction.Amazon, Ciera Velarde / BuzzFeedI started using this while half marathon training because the inside of my big toes ALWAYS get blisters no matter how well my shoes fit or what socks I wear. I loved how much better they worked than regular bandages. They're much bigger than bandages, they stick really well to your skin, and they move with you instead of sliding around and falling off. They really saved my toes while running, and I've continued to wear them whenever I know I'm going to be walking a lot. One thing to keep in mind is that they are very sticky, which means that if you use them to cover up a blister that's already formed, it could rip off the soft top of your blister when you're taking it off (speaking from experience here!) So just make sure to only use this to prevent, not treat a blister.Promising review: \"Forget normal bandages — if you are prone to blisters, always have this tape on hand. It is excellent to prevent or help you walk if you have blisters. I keep two cases on hand: one at home and the other in my travel bag. Stays on until you take them off (even while bathing).

I just moved out to the country and have been working out in the garage late at night.

I have dead bees, stink bugs, gnats, mosquitoes, and other bugs that I do not know what they are.

It has enough fabric that you can cover up if you're cold or want to block out light or bugs. We have accidentally left it out in the rain several times, and it dries great, hasn't faded from the sun, hasn't had any mold, and hasn't developed any weird smell.Things not to love: Nothing!

      "Antonio Planas and Madelyn Urabe\n",
      "A fire chief in South Carolina who told officials he pointed a gun at two teenagers after they turned into his driveway last year has been accused of assault and false imprisonment in a lawsuit as police reopen their investigation. The teens drove into Billy McAdams’ driveway in Townville on Aug. 29 and turned around while scouting hunting sites for geese season, according to an incident report and 911 calls provided Friday by the Oconee County Sheriff’s Office. They were followed for several minutes by two pickups through two counties until they were blocked in by one and forced out of their truck and onto the ground by McAdams, who pointed a pistol at them, according to the suit, an incident report and 911 calls. The mothers of the teens, who are now 17, filed a suit against McAdams, who at the time of the incident was the Townville fire chief, and his son. The suit accuses them of causing the teens emotional distress by forcing them out of the vehicle at gunpoint and chasing them at a high rate of speed and nearly colliding with them. “First and foremost, Mr. McAdams is extremely concerned about the situation and is committed to addressing any allegations with the utmost sincerity and cooperation,\" Amanda Bradley, who is representing the father and son in the lawsuit, said in a statement.   \"We believe a complete picture of all the facts will validate our client’s position and are confident in the ability of the legal system to deliver justice.” A spokesperson with the sheriff’s office confirmed Friday that the agency last week reopened an investigation into the incident after Sheriff Mike Crenshaw received a letter asking why no charges had been filed. “He made a decision to re-open the case,” said Master Deputy Jimmy Watt, a spokesperson for the sheriff’s office. “The case has been transferred to an investigator with the sheriff’s office’s Criminal Investigations Bureau.” The Townville Fire Department could not be reached Friday for comment. It was not clear if McAdams was still the fire chief. The sheriff’s office provided NBC News with six 911 calls of the incident. In one, a teen is heard telling a dispatcher, “We were going to pull over to just like tell them what we were doing but they were extremely enraged. And we didn’t want to have a gun pulled on us, or anything like that.” The boy who initially called the dispatcher tells her, “They’re yelling at us and they have guns pointed,” before clarifying that only one gun is pointed at them. The dispatcher then says, “Stay in your car and lock the doors, OK. Don’t get out. Don’t yell at them.” The teen on the phone with the dispatcher then says, “They’re making us get out of the car with guns. … They’re making us get on the ground — I’m sorry. We’re getting on the ground.”  In another 911 call recording, a teen tells the dispatcher the gunman “put the gun away” and “he just took the bullet out.” Billy McAdams is then heard on the recording talking to the dispatcher who tells him, “Billy, listen, can you get in your vehicle as well and just not talk to them and separate yourself from them? We got people headed that way.” According to an incident report, McAdams told investigators he’s had a lot of thefts on his farm property and didn’t know who pulled into his driveway because the truck’s windows were tinted. He also admitted to pointing his pistol, the report stated.  “McAdams stated, not knowing who the subjects were, he drew his handgun” and told them to “get on the ground,” the report said. A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Clayton L. Jennings, said Friday that his clients “stand behind the allegations in the lawsuit,\" which requests a jury trial, reimbursement for attorney fees and damages determined by the court. There have been several recent high-profile incidents involving guns after drivers pulled into driveways. In April, Kaylin Gillis, 20, was fatally shot by a resident in upstate New York, after her boyfriend pulled into the wrong driveway while looking for a party. In late May, a Florida man was charged with aggravated assault after allegedly pointing a gun at a woman’s head when her friend used the suspect’s driveway to back up a vehicle. \n",

      "Richard Engel and Yuliya Talmazan and Ken Dilanian\n",
      "Yevgeny Prigozhin used his close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin to get rich and build a private army — then marched it on Moscow in a stunning challenge to his former boss’s rule. The Wagner mercenary group chief now appears to have abandoned that rebellion for exile in Belarus, in a deal that leaves more questions than answers. “Prigozhin would be naive to think this is over,” Michael A. Horowitz, a geopolitical and security analyst who is the head of intelligence at Le Beck consultancy, told NBC News. Here’s a look at the man behind Russia’s biggest insurrection in its post-Soviet history, who went from prison to leading a military revolt that got within a hundred or so miles of Moscow. Who knows what’s next. How did Prigozhin build Wagner?  A St. Petersburg native like Putin, Prigozhin, 62, has one of the most varied biographies among the Kremlin elite. He has admitted to serving 10 years in prison as a young man, though he has not said what for. He then grew a hot-dog stand into a chain of upscale restaurants, eventually drawing the Russian president’s attention and earning lucrative contracts to cater for public school and Kremlin events, which earned him the nickname “Putin’s chef.”  Over time, Prigohzin has catered to a variety of Putin’s other needs. The Russian leader has sought to project influence around the world — from his neighbors in eastern Europe to the Middle East and Africa  — and Prigozhin has helped him do it. Around 2014, he created Wagner, according to a member who was recruited to the mercenary outfit by Prigozhin in its early days.  The Kremlin had just seized Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and had its sights on the eastern Donbas region, where a conflict was brewing after mass protests in Kyiv toppled a pro-Russian government. Suddenly, Putin had a war on his hands but did not want to send in regular army troops or call up a draft and face the possibility of Russians coming home in body bags.   So Prigozhin provided a solution.  He created a force of undesirables, people with military experience or a history of violence who were looking for jobs and may be less likely to be missed if they were killed. Wagner’s early operations in Ukraine were somewhat successful, and the conflict there continued without pushback from the Russian public.  The Kremlin has always denied any official military presence in eastern Ukraine, and while Prigozhin had previously refuted suggestions that he was connected to Wagner, last year he admitted on social media that he had created the group in 2014 and it had taken part in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Prigohzin’s next mission got much more attention, particularly from the U.S.  He founded the Internet Research Agency, the bot farm that interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, polluting social media with disinformation, lies and skepticism about the legitimacy of the electoral process. Whether it swayed the outcome of the election remains an open question, but the U.S. intelligence community called it out and sanctioned Prigozhin, who said last year that he had interfered in U.S. elections and would continue to do so. After that came Russia’s intervention in the war in Syria. Putin wanted to back President Bashar al-Assad and fight rebels backed by the West, but, again, do it off the books with few official Russian casualties. There, Wagner once again became instrumental to his efforts, and its fighters remain on the ground in the Middle Eastern country many years later.  Ever the entrepreneur, Prigozhin also expanded his operations into Africa.   In the Central African Republic, Prigohzin discovered that if Wagner propped up the weak government and helped it fight off a rebellion, the group could help itself to the impoverished country’s resources, mainly gold and blood diamonds.  Now the man who restarted his life with a single hot-dog stand had an army that was battle tested, experienced in disinformation, and perhaps most crucially, had its own independent source of funding.   From Bakhmut to Moscow: What sparked the rebellion? With the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Prigozhin was able and eager to again prove his value to Putin. As the Russian army came up against surprisingly strong resistance, Wagner’s mercenaries came in handy in the bloodiest of battles. To bolster their ranks, Prigozhin turned to a place he knew well, promising convicts in Russian prisons freedom if they could survive more than six months on the front lines.  Wagner led the fighting for several key Ukrainian cities, including Bakhmut, an eastern city that became a key symbolic prize for Putin when he claimed to have seized it last month at the cost of thousands of men.  While he touted his mercenary forces as game changers in Ukraine and gradually entered the public spotlight, Prigozhin increasingly clashed with the military establishment in Moscow. Using his well-oiled social media machine, Prigozhin emerged as a leading voice for hardliners and influential pro-war figures who were critical of the Kremlin’s approach to the war. He accused the Defense Ministry and its head, Sergei Shoigu, of downplaying Wagner’s role and not supplying his fighters with sufficient ammunition, while blaming “incompetent” military leadership for Russia’s failures in Ukraine. The bitter feud escalated in recent weeks as Moscow gave all private mercenary forces until July 1 to sign contracts with the Defense Ministry, which Prigozhin refused.  The standoff then exploded and Prigozhin launched an armed rebellion on Friday after alleging that the Russian army fired at his mercenaries.  While Putin initially seemed happy to let the internal squabbles play out, it appears even the Russian leader may have underestimated just how powerful and daring Prigohzin had become.  “I think what really triggered his decision to carry out a mad dash toward Moscow was the order issued earlier this month,” said Horowitz, referring to the demand that his fighters sign Defense Ministry contracts. Prigozhin saw this as a “prelude to disbanding” the private army he had worked for years to build, Horowitz said. This was a signal for the mercenary chief that “Putin had sided with his enemies,” he said, adding that Prigozhin “may have felt that his own safety was no longer guaranteed, in the long run, and that if he did not act he would end up sidelined (at best) or dead. He had nothing to lose.” Ahead of the rebellion, U.S. intelligence agencies had collected information that Prigozhin had been planning to challenge Russia’s senior military leaders and briefed congressional leaders about it last week, a source familiar with the matter told NBC News. They added that the intelligence revealed that Wagner had been amassing forces and weapons, although the intelligence wasn’t definitive.  What now?  In the end, it’s unclear what Prigozhin has gained.  He said Saturday he was within 120 miles of the Russian capital but decided to turn his troops around to “avoid spilling Russian blood.” The Kremlin said Prigozhin would not face any charges and would go to Belarus, whose leader, Alexander Lukashenko, apparently helped broker the deal.  A big question that’s left hanging is what will happen to his Wagner troops?  The Kremlin has said it would not prosecute those fighters who took part in the rebellion, and that Wagner forces could still sign contracts with the Defense Ministry if they wanted to. It’s possible that the estimated 25,000 Wagner fighters will be dispersed, “under suspicion,” across Russia’s regular army, said Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe. As for Prigozhin himself, the true nature of the resolution to the crisis remains unknown, as is the Wagner chief’s future.  But Putin is not known to allow his enemies to live quietly in exile, and his description of Prigozhin as a traitor suggests he viewed the revolt, like many analysts, as a direct threat to his rule. “Going to Belarus may be an option — he seems to know and trust Lukashenko very well — but he would still be in danger there,” said Horowitz. “My best bet is that he will continue to operate in Ukraine, rather than Belarus, where he can justify maintaining relative freedom among men who are loyal to him. “But either way, he has cornered himself by either going too far, or not going far enough,” Horowitz said. “If he lays low, he may still end up drinking poisoned tea, and if he is too loud, he will become even more of a liability for Moscow.” \n",

      "https://www.wired.com/story/evidence-of-low-frequency-gravitational-waves/\n",
      "Ramin Skibba\n",
      "The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) published its new findings in a series of papers today in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. The team will present their results to the public on Thursday afternoon at the National Science Foundation and on YouTube. The NANOGrav team coordinated with international colleagues, with separate collaborations in Europe, India, Australia, and China releasing similar findings at the same time. The consistency among the groups lends weight to their conclusions, which are that these long-theorized waves actually exist.\n",
      "“We’ve been on a mission for the last 15 years to find a low-pitched hum of gravitational waves resounding throughout the universe and washing through our galaxy to warp space-time in a measurable way. We’re very happy to announce that our hard work has paid off,” said Stephen Taylor, the NANOGrav chair, at a press briefing on June 27.\n",
      "The NANOGrav measurement is consistent with predictions from Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity, Taylor said. According to that theory, black holes spiraling into each other should cause wrinkles in the fabric of space-time, and those distortions should propagate outward at the speed of light. But a century ago, detecting such a thing from Earth seemed virtually impossible. And indeed, those nearly imperceptible waves were not found until 2015, when the US-based Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory collaboration, or LIGO, exhilarated the physics world by detecting one.\n",
      "The LIGO group, along with the Virgo collaboration in Europe, have since found dozens more, mostly from merging pairs of star-sized black holes, as well as a couple of mergers between black holes and neutron stars. But the gravitational waves the NANOGrav scientists look for are very different: They’re measured at much lower frequencies, and they probably originate from supermassive black holes, gargantuan objects lying at the center of most galaxies, including our own, and weighing as much as hundreds of millions or even billions of suns. In the publications released by NANOGrav and the other teams, the scientists describe their analysis while also showing how gravitational waves are permeating the cosmos. They also speculate about other possible origins if they don’t come from large black holes after all—exotic candidates like cosmic strings or cosmic inflation.\n",
      "NANOGrav and its international counterparts, like the European Pulsar Timing Array, measured the gravitational waves’ signal by making use of pulsars scattered about the galaxy. Sometimes called “space lighthouses,” pulsars are the cores of dead, massive stars that have collapsed under their own weight and gone supernova. Some of them rotate hundreds of times per second while beaming radiation from their magnetic axes. Researchers use those pulses as incredibly precise cosmic clocks, pinpointing the pulsars’ locations.\n",
      "The NANOGrav team was essentially able to turn the Milky Way into a giant gravitational wave detector by measuring the signals from these pulsars to determine when a wave nudged them. The collision of enormous black holes—or some other extremely energetic process—generates gravitational waves that ever-so-slightly squeeze and stretch space-time, tweaking the intervals between pulsar blips. NANOGrav researchers measured those minuscule changes among 68 pulsars, then correlated them, finding a pattern that is likely the sign of low-frequency gravitational waves. The other collaborating teams did the same with separate sets of pulsars.\n",
      "It took more than a decade of data collection and analysis for the teams to reduce their measurement uncertainties and to be sure that they’d spotted a real sign of gravitational waves rather than some other cosmic phenomenon or mere noise. The NANOGrav team, which includes nearly 200 people, conducted a statistical analysis and found less than one-in-a-thousand odds that the signal they observed could happen by chance. The other collaborations found similar levels of statistical significance.\n",
      "While these are very likely to be signs of real gravitational waves from colossal black holes, the teams are reluctant to use the word “detection” to describe their findings. Nine years ago, the US-based BICEP2 collaboration, using a telescope at the South Pole, claimed to have detected primordial gravitational waves coming from the big bang, only to find that their signal actually came from pesky dust grains in the Milky Way—and that has made researchers circumspect about their conclusions. “The gravitational wave community is very cautious about these kinds of things,” says Scott Ransom, an astronomer with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory and former chair of NANOGrav.\n",
      "For their measurements, the NANOGrav team made use of several radio telescopes: the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia, the Very Large Array in New Mexico, and the huge Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, an iconic instrument that collapsed in 2020. The other teams used radio telescopes in five European countries, India, China, and Australia. More telescopes have recently joined the effort, including CHIME in Canada and MeerTime in South Africa.\n",
      "The collaboration between scientists in the US and China is notable, says Ransom. While a controversial 2011 law called the Wolf Amendment forbids NASA from working directly with Chinese entities because of security concerns, such restrictions don’t apply to National Science Foundation–funded efforts like NANOGrav. “The politics have made some of our collaborations tricky,” Ransom says. “We have to figure out a way to work together, because the science is definitely better when we do that. It’s terrible being hamstrung by politics.”\n",
      "The teams coordinate with each other through a sort of super-collaboration called the International Pulsar Timing Array. While the group’s geographic span makes it challenging for the scientists to communicate across time zones, they’re able to combine their data sets, improving their precision and their confidence in their measurements. “One cannot construct a galaxy-sized gravitational wave telescope in your backyard,” wrote Michael Keith, an astrophysicist on the European Pulsar Timing Array executive committee, in an email to WIRED. “It takes a combined effort of hundreds of astronomers, theorists, engineers, and administrators to study the universe at this scale.” \n",

      "Chris Stokel-Walker\n",
      "It's a $4, 114-page coffee-table-style periodical filled with luscious, outlandish images and little else. There’s an eight-page interview, conducted by a human, with Bob Bonniol, a creative designer who has taken to using Midjourney to help iterate ideas. The Q&A aside, the title has very few of its own ideas at all.\n",
      "The rest is just pages upon pages of large images of varying quality in varying genres, which are roughly grouped together based on theme and captioned with the prompt used to generate them, the human who gave that prompt, and the date they queried Midjourney, the generative AI platform from which its content is taken. (Midjourney is also the name of the company behind the tool, and the publisher of Midjourney.)\n",
      "A profile photograph of a pensive female cyborg, all glossy, reflective metal skin, looking demurely down out of frame, sits on the same spread as what can only be described as a rejected character design for a Warhammer 40,000 figurine. The thing that seems to unite them in theme is “not human” and “a little disconcerting.”\n",
      "Sometimes the themes slip. While the spread on pages 78 and 79 hangs together well, with an image of a woman in a yellow hat titled “in the style of fan ho, andy Goldsworthy, alex prager, anna atkins, franco fontana, Rosalyn drelxer ::1 umbrellas ::-0.02 styled by alan lee ::-0.48” sitting alongside “don’t look at the eloquent red circle, surreal, glistening highlights –ar2:3 –s 33” (which features a woman looking at a blood-red moon), others don’t do so well. Three cats wearing bathrobes doing tai chi in a bonsai-filled courtyard sit on the page opposite an image of a man walking on the Big Apple’s sidewalk that wouldn’t look out of place on Humans of New York.\n",
      "It is enormously impressive to flick through. But when you start to look for more it falls flat. “It looks like a standard glossy magazine, with nice pictures and a simple layout,” says Michelle Pegg, cofounder of Curate Creative, a UK-based creative agency, “but as a magazine is a vehicle for stories and expression, and connecting with the reader, I feel it goes no further than the set of glossy pics.”\n",
      "And I agree. In part this could be sour grapes: I work in an industry that has historically relied on being able to sell magazines as a luxury product, one carefully curated for you. They’re so expensive because, as advertising revenues that subsidized many titles have disappeared, publishers have been loath to scrimp on standards. Photo editors cost money. Designers, too. Journalists and editors and fact-checkers don’t come cheap.\n",
      "But AI does—at least it does when its huge computing costs are subsidized by venture capital or the beneficence of Big Tech firms, as has happened so far with the rise of generative AI.\n",
      "Yet the things that cost money are the things that give magazines their quality. The ability to see something you hadn’t expected is what separates printed products from the internet. It’s why those who love magazines do so fiercely. And it’s why I’m conflicted by Midjourney Magazine. I want to like it. But it’s soulless.\n",
      "Pegg explains the problem well, comparing it to the “alt text on a website image.” Her main problem with the magazine echoes the fear many have with AI writ large. “The big thing missing in the magazine is the human connection,” she says. “No stories, no obvious reason behind the images that I want to know more about, no reason for that style.”\n",
      "She says that the magazine has “no depth, just pretty enough pictures.” And she has qualms—as many do with AI-generated images—about the extent to which the work skirts on the right side of copyright laws.\n",
      "One photo, on page 11, shows the results of a prompt asking for a 1940s-style photograph of a woman looking like Judy Garland, which almost exactly matches her facial features, suggesting the underlying model has been trained on images of the Hollywood icon.\n",
      "“How will we know if what’s produced isn’t plagiarizing an artist’s work as it draws from what’s already out there?” Pegg asks. It’s an issue that Midjourney is reckoning with right now—it’s currently facing a class-action lawsuit over alleged copyright infringement. Midjourney claims in its defense that none of the plaintiffs in the case can point to their art being used as training data.\n",
      "The magazine’s tagline ends with the claim it is “expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.” That’s something Pegg doesn’t necessarily dispute—some people will feel that way, she’s sure—but she does admit it doesn’t feel that way for her. “My first question on anything is always, why? What’s behind this? What’s the story?”\n",
      "That’s not a question AI feels well equipped to answer—at least not yet. \n",

      "ChatGPT has been a game changer for artificial intelligence, catapulting earlier this year to the fastest-growing web platform ever as millions of people across the world rushed to communicate with a system that can mimic human conversation. The system, however, is unable to respond to current events questions due to having a knowledge cutoff date of September 2021. When Fox News Digital, for example, attempted to ask ChatGPT questions about current events, such as if the Titan submersible implosion could have been prevented or what charges Hunter Biden was hit with this month, the chatbot responded that it does not have knowledge of current events after September 2021. \"As an AI language model, I have a knowledge cutoff date because my training data only goes up until September 2021,\" ChatGPT responded when asked why it does not possess language beyond September 2021. \"The cutoff date represents the point at which the data used to train me ends, and I do not have access to information or events that have occurred after that time.\" I INTERVIEWED CHATGPT AS IF IT WAS A HUMAN; HERE'S WHAT IT HAD TO SAY THAT GAVE ME CHILLS  The chatbot continued that the motivation behind the cutoff date \"is to make it clear to users that I may not be aware of recent developments or up-to-date information.\" \"It's important to keep in mind that any responses I provide about events, news, or technology beyond September 2021 are based on my training and may not reflect the most current information,\" the chatbot said. ChatGPT runs on Generative Pre-training Transformer-4, meaning it's not connected to the internet and instead only uses the material it was trained on to craft responses to users. WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF AI? \"ChatGPT is not connected to the internet, and it can occasionally produce incorrect answers. It has limited knowledge of world and events after 2021 and may also occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content,\" OpenAI states on its website.&nbsp;  ChatGPT was released in November and quickly grew to 100 million monthly active users by January, setting a record as the fastest-growing user base ever. Its release served as a watershed moment for the tech community, sparking other artificial intelligence labs to hit the turbo button on building comparable or more intelligent programs. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE QUIZ! HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW AI?  Google, for example, released its version of a chatbot, called Bard, in March. The system did not receive the same acclaim as ChatGPT but stands in stark contrast to ChatGPT on one important aspect: Bard can search the internet to respond to users. Bard is able to respond to users on current events, such as the unrest in Russia, due to searching the internet via news articles, social media and expert opinions. WHAT IS GOOGLE BARD? HOW THE AI CHATBOT WORKS, HOW TO USE IT AND WHY IT'S CONTROVERSIAL \"Bard is trained on a massive dataset of news articles, which gives it a broad understanding of current events,\" Bard responded when asked how it is able to answer questions on current events, noting the system also draws responses from social media and experts who have publicly spoken out about the topic online. \"When you ask Bard a question about current events, it can search its knowledge base for relevant news articles and provide you with a summary of the information it finds.\" Tech developers are taking the powerful systems a step farther and are working to build AI-integrated search engines. Google, for example, released its experimental Search Generative Experience, or SGE, in May that integrates AI-generated responses into search results.

      "The restaurant industry is currently grappling with a new scam specifically targeted at people looking to make online reservations. Hackers have set their sights on exploiting OpenTable, a widely used service that includes nearly 60,000 restaurants around the globe. The scammers are using OpenTable to illicitly obtain information from those who use the service.&nbsp; What is OpenTable?  CLICK TO GET KURT’S FREE CYBERGUY NEWSLETTER WITH SECURITY ALERTS, QUICK TIPS, TECH REVIEWS AND EASY HOW-TO’S TO MAKE YOU SMARTER&nbsp; OpenTable is an online restaurant reservation service that allows you to search for and book reservations at various restaurants online without having to call the restaurant directly. You can use the filters to adjust the date, time, and number of people included in your reservation, as well as any other specific filters included with the restaurant you're attending, such as if you prefer to have a table inside or outside.&nbsp; The service is accessible through the OpenTable website and the OpenTable mobile app, which is available for download on iOS and Android devices. You can browse restaurants, view menus, read reviews, and make reservations directly through the platform.&nbsp; iPhone: 3.8 stars (at the time of publishing) &nbsp; Android: 4.7 stars (at the time of publishing) &nbsp;  What information does OpenTable ask for?  CROOKS ARE TARGETING THIS EASY MONEY APP ON YOUR PHONE Once you've completed all the details for your reservation, the website will ask you for some personal information like your name, email address, and phone number. This information is only asked so that the restaurant has a way to contact you should something change with your reservation. However, depending on the restaurant's policies, it will typically not ask you to give over credit card details to finalize the reservation. This is where the scammers come in.&nbsp; How does the OpenTable scam work?  Scammers have been calling people and pretending to be from the restaurant where a reservation has been made to \"confirm\" the details. And with that confirmation, the scammer will also tell the victim that it is required for them to give over their credit card details to keep their reservation spot.&nbsp; Once they have the card details, they will then call again and pretend to be from your bank. They'll tell the victim that there has been \"unusual activity\" with their credit card that can only be stopped by authorizing a purchase from your bank's mobile app. Many victims will panic and authorize the transaction before they realize it's a scam, and now the criminal has full access to use your card.&nbsp; MORE: MASSIVE DISTRIBUTION OF MALWARE EXPOSES GAMERS TO THEFT AND DATA BREACHES &nbsp; How do the scammers get your information in the first place?  Scammers get this information by calling restaurants pretending to work for OpenTable and asking for their login credentials. Then, they use those credentials to access the restaurant’s account and call customers with reservations pretending to be from the restaurant. They ask for their credit card details to take or refund a deposit for their bookings and then use those details to make unauthorized transactions. &nbsp; TO GET MY SECURITY ALERTS, SUBSCRIBE TO MY FREE CYBERGUY REPORT NEWSLETTER BY HEADING TO CYBERGUY.COM/NEWSLETTER&nbsp;&nbsp;  What should I do to avoid this reservation service scam?  AVOID THESE SCAMMERS' SNEAKY TRICKS There are a few steps you can take to avoid falling for this scam, even if you're someone who uses online reservation services often. Here are some of my tips for avoiding this scam.&nbsp; Hang up on suspicious calls  If you receive a call from someone claiming to be from the restaurant you made a reservation at or from your bank and they're asking for credit card information, hang up the phone. There is no reason for a restaurant to have your credit card information unless they have a policy about charging people for last-minute cancellations. Even so, you should hang up and call the restaurant back yourself using their official phone number to confirm if this is a real policy or not.&nbsp; Keep a close eye on your bank  You should never authorize any purchases to be made through your banking app or credit card that you did not make yourself. If you see any suspicious transactions come up, call your bank or credit card company immediately and have them walk you through the steps to fix it.&nbsp; MORE: MASSIVE FREE VPN DATA BREACH EXPOSES 360M RECORDS &nbsp; Report the scammers immediately  OpenTable has sent out a mass alert to all its users to warn them about these scams that have been going around. They urge people to notify them via email at phishing@opentable.com in case they receive any suspicious phone calls claiming to be from restaurants.&nbsp;  Use identity theft protection  Since many people's personal information was exposed from this data breach with reservation websites, it's best for you to know how to protect yourself should your information ever get exposed. Identity Theft protection companies can monitor personal information like your Home title, Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.&nbsp; One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of up to 1 million dollars to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.&nbsp; See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft by visiting CyberGuy.com/IdentityTheft&nbsp; Kurt's key takeaways  Making reservations at local restaurants should be a hassle-free experience However, the unfortunate reality is that even something as simple as reserving a table now requires an additional concern. It's important to remain vigilant when using online reservation services like OpenTable to safeguard against scams. Remember to heed my advice, stay alert, and maintain a cautious mindset throughout the process, regardless of how straightforward it may seem.&nbsp; Do you think reservation websites should up their security measures from now on? Should restaurants stop using third-party websites to keep track of their reservations?

      "TechnologyRegulatory OversightProduct LiabilityGovernmentLitigationAmazon duped millions of consumers into enrolling in Prime, US FTC saysBy David ShepardsonJune 22, 20231:28 AM UTCUpdated  agoCompaniesAmazon.com IncFollowWASHINGTON, June 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday accused Amazon.com (AMZN.O) of enrolling millions of consumers into its paid subscription Amazon Prime service without their consent and making it hard for them to cancel, the agency's latest action against the ecommerce giant in recent weeks.The FTC sued Amazon in federal court in Seattle, alleging that the company has \"knowingly duped millions of consumers into unknowingly enrolling in Amazon Prime.\" In a statement, Amazon called the FTC's claims \"false on the facts and the law.\"Amazon has used \"manipulative, coercive or deceptive user-interface designs known as 'dark patterns' to trick consumers into enrolling in automatically renewing Prime subscriptions,\" the FTC said as it seeks civil penalties and a permanent injunction to prevent future violations.The lawsuit is one of several actions taken by President Joe Biden's administration intended to rein in the outsized market power of Big Tech firms as it tries to increase competition to protect consumers.The FTC said Amazon Prime is the world's largest subscription program, generating $25 billion in revenue annually. It offers fast, free shipping on millions of items, various discounts and access to movies, music and television series, as well as other benefits.Prime members in the United States pay $139 per year and drive much of Amazon's sales volume. Prime, which has more than 200 million members worldwide, is crucial to Amazon's other businesses including its streaming service Prime Video and its grocery delivery service.In its statement, Amazon said, \"The truth is that customers love Prime, and by design we make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up for or cancel their Prime membership.\"Amazon added it finds \"it concerning that the FTC announced this lawsuit without notice to us, in the midst of our discussions with FTC staff members to ensure they understand the facts, context, and legal issues, and before we were able to have a dialog with the commissioners themselves.\"Wednesday's lawsuit came on the day Amazon announced the July dates of its major sales event Prime Day.An Amazon Prime truck is pictured as it crosses the George Washington Bridge on Interstate Route 95 during Amazon's two-day \"Prime Early Access Sale\" shopping event for Amazon members in New York City, New York, U.S., October 11, 2022. REUTERS/Mike SegarThe lawsuit said that under substantial pressure from the FTC, Amazon changed its cancellation process in April but that \"violations are ongoing\" and that it still \"requires five clicks on desktop and six on mobile for consumers to cancel from Amazon.com.\"Amazon's shares were up 0.2% in afternoon trading.The FTC has been investigating sign-up and cancellation processes for the Prime program since March 2021.Consumers who attempted to cancel Prime were faced with multiple labyrinthine steps to accomplish the task of cancelling, according to the complaint. The FTC complaint said Amazon used the term \"Iliad Flow\" to describe the process it began in 2016, referencing Homer's epic poem about the lengthy Trojan war.Amazon also committed \"intentional misconduct\" meant to delay the FTC's investigation by providing \"bad faith\" responses to requests for documents, the agency said.Insider Intelligence senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf said that the \"FTC is making an example of Amazon, but it's quite common for companies to make it more difficult to cancel an account than it is to create one.\"\"Amazon's market power might work against it in this instance, as the FTC won't have a hard time proving that consumers are, indeed, harmed if Amazon impedes their ability to exercise their choice to cancel their Prime membership,\" Mitchell-Wolf added.The FTC on May 31 announced a $5.8 million settlement with Amazon's Ring doorbell camera unit after the agency said cameras had been used for spying on some customers. On the same day, the FTC said Amazon agreed to pay $25 million to settle allegations that it violated children's privacy rights by failing to delete Alexa virtual assistant technology recordings at the request of parents and keeping them longer than necessary.The new lawsuit is \"emblematic of efforts by governments across the globe to rein in the excess influence of big tech,\" including Amazon, Apple and Meta, according to Tom Forte, managing director at D.A. Davidson Companies.But Forte also pointed to other retailers and subscription services that make it difficult to end memberships.Reporting by David Shepardson and Chris Sanders in Washington; Additional reporting by Arriana McLymore; Editing by Will DunhamOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Read Next / Editor's Picksarticle with videoBusinesscategoryUPS, Teamsters accuse each other of walking away from contract talksJuly 5, 2023article with galleryBusinesscategoryRussia bans tiny U.S.-based NGO for \"sabotaging\" vast gas pipelineJuly 5, 2023BusinesscategoryJetBlue says it will end alliance with American to save Spirit merger dealJuly 5, 2023 .

      "“All of us collectively found this thing to fill our gap of exciting things happening in our lives,” More said. \n",
      "She owns the TikTok and Instagram accounts @Zillowtastrophes.\n",
      "“If you found something crazy, it was like hitting the jackpot … and you wanted to share it with other people,” she added.\n",
      "As someone who works with social media professionally, More saw TikTok as the next big thing and used her newfound hobby to explore the once-new platform, she said.\n",
      "She first started sending her Zillow discoveries to her friends, she said and then expanded it by creating @Zillowtastrophes.\n",

      "“It has taken off from there. I couldn’t slow it down if I wanted to.”\n",
      "Within a year, More had reached roughly 100,000 followers. She’s had a few posts go viral, which have helped her grow her page.\n",

      "On March 10, for example, More’s post about an Oklahoma listing was viewed 1.7 million times on TikTok after she featured a home that included a “doll jail,” as she captioned it, which showed a backyard-accessible underground room that was housing a bunch of dolls.\n",
      "Other homes that More has posted include a converted missile silo, the ‘Brady Bunch house’ a ‘troll house’ under a bridge and a home with a pyramid in its backyard. \n",

      "For service companies that experience a summer slowdown every year, finding ways to keep staff members productive during this time is crucial for maintaining momentum and utilizing resources effectively. While customer or client work may decrease, there are many valuable activities that employees can engage in to make the most of their and the company’s time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, 18 Forbes Coaches Council members highlight strategies companies can use to ensure teams remain productive during the summertime. From professional development and skills training to brainstorming sessions to make process improvements and enhance internal operations, check out the various avenues service companies can take to help team members focus their efforts in the most beneficial ways when business is slow below.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Focus On Free Professional Development\n",
      "During a summer slowdown, service companies can keep staff productive by focusing on free professional development, process improvement, research, team building, creative projects, networking and free employee well-being initiatives. These activities maximize employee engagement and contribute to long-term growth. - Foluso Gbadamosi, FolusoGbadamosi.com\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Evaluate What Can Be Improved\n",
      "I love saying, “Go slow to go fast,” and summer slowdowns are a great time to invest in personal leadership development. Leadership starts with the person. Slow seasons are also great for evaluating which systems, tools or processes need to be revamped. Lastly, the gift of “free” vacation time for employees (whether it is a day or more) from the company goes a long way to rejuvenate staff members for busy times. - Melissa DeLuca, DeLuca & Willow\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Reflect On What Has Gone Well And Not So Well\n",
      "During a summer slowdown, I would focus on three specific things: Take time to reflect on what has gone well, what hasn’t gone so well and what we can take forward. There is energy that can be taken from reminding ourselves of our success, and learning is invaluable for growth. Second, sharpen the saw and focus on personal development. Finally, I would look at high-impact, short-burst projects to set us up for success. - Ricky Muddimer, Thinking Focus\n",
      "MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesByAmy DaniseEditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansByAmy DaniseEditor\n",
      "4. Maximize Employees’ Talent\n",
      "Ask employees what they want to contribute in specific areas of the business that will further a certain strategic goal, and then agree on the parameters. This will keep them engaged and excited to be contributing to a valuable, possibly new function for when the business will be back in the swing of things! - Cellene Hoogenkamp, KokuaHub Inc\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Prepare To Cope With Future Challenges\n",
      "A popular saying advises that “you have to redo your roof when the weather is nice!” A business slowdown is a very good time to step back from the daily routines and do a strategic review of activities. Here are some questions to answer: “Are we prepared for the next challenges? Are we investing enough in people, technologies and innovation to cope with future challenges, both ecological and social?” - Catherine Tanneau, Activision Coaching Institute\n",

      "Forbes Coaches Council is an invitation-only community for leading business and career coaches. Do I qualify?\n",
      "6. Get Strategic And Build New, Faster Systems\n",
      "When business is slow, get strategic! Any slowdown is a perfect time to invest in building new systems to handle scale and speed. When you have space in the calendar is the time to build templates, processes and business continuity systems, as well as purge inventory and document libraries. Slow times are when you lay the foundation to make the faster times smooth! - David Taylor-Klaus, MCC, CPCC, CTPC, DTK Coaching, LLC\n",
      "7. Brainstorm Future Services\n",
      "During slowdowns, companies get an incredible opportunity to work on building their team, planning forward, brainstorming future services, reviewing their current processes, testing services for validation and training on new skills that the team may need. This opportunity allows for great growth inside a company if used wisely. - Bobbie Goheen, Synthesis Management Group\n",
      "8. Tie Up Loose Ends, Then Rest And Recharge\n",
      "There is an ebb and flow in life and in business. The key here is to understand that everything is cyclical and change is always around the corner. I encourage my clients to take advantage of the slower times and work on the business by tying up loose ends, getting organized in-house, strategizing on business development and doing some fun team-building activities. Rest and recharge for the busy season—it’s coming! - Cheryl Keates, PCC, Cheryl Keates\n",
      "9. Conduct Team-Building Activities\n",
      "A slow period is the perfect time to evaluate the efficiency of the business. Looking at department policies, processes and service offerings to determine if any changes are necessary will allow the company to help more customers during the busy season. This is also a great time for team building through volunteer days, cleaning the space, and training and development. - Lindsay Miller, Reverie Organizational Development Specialists\n",
      "10. Focus On Meeting Training Goals\n",
      "Focusing on meeting training goals for personal and professional development can effectively fill the time during a summer slowdown for service-based companies. This reminds employees they have the power to move the needle in their career trajectories and builds their growth mindset. - Ariel McGrew, Tactful Disruption®\n",
      "11. Cross-Train Employees\n",
      "One of the strategies that companies can use to keep their staff members productive during the summertime is to cross-train employees. By teaching staff members new skills or having them work in different areas of the business, you can help them stay motivated and prevent boredom or burnout. It is also a great way to keep them engaged and productive when facing a summer slowdown. - Paula Vidal Castelli, Paula Vidal Castelli Intl., LLC\n",
      "12. Hire A Development Trainer Or Facilitator\n",
      "A summer slowdown is the best period to use spare time for learning and development so that staff members can sharpen their skills and knowledge or learn new skills to be ready for the peak season. Hiring a trainer or facilitator can be a great way to ensure learning and development will not only benefit personal growth, but also business growth. - Senem Anataca, 180UTC\n",
      "13. Work On Improving Internal Operations\n",
      "One of my favorite quotes is, “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems,” by James Clear. If there is downtime, businesses should always be working on improving internal operations, such as processes, IT systems and so forth. This will not only likely save the business money, but it also will increase the engagement of your team. - Wendy Fong, Chief Gigs\n",
      "14. Conduct Market And User Research\n",
      "Here are three ways companies can take advantage of slow times during the summer: 1. Hire a training company to train staff on new systems, such as AI technologies. 2. Carry out business process improvement initiatives by mapping out, analyzing and improving existing processes. 3. Conduct market and user research—review all customer databases as well as competitors’ data, and create an improvement action plan for the busy periods. - Eno Eka, The Business Analysis School\n",
      "15. Innovate And Collaborate\n",
      "A summer slowdown allows for space to create. Task your staff with working on projects that set their hearts on fire and are of high service to your clients. Test out a new offering. Connect with your best customers. If you can do this as a team, even better! - Amy Pocsik, Bold Moves\n",
      "16. Reflect On Where You Are And Start A Passion Project\n",
      "A common frustration I hear from successful people is that they struggle to make time for strategic thinking. A natural slow point is perfect for reflecting on your direction of travel and on the balance you’re striking. How do you really feel about the life you are creating? Where do you want to course-correct? Then use passion projects as a vehicle for indulging and expanding your capabilities. - Duncan Skelton, Duncan Skelton Coaching Ltd\n",
      "17. Create New Products And Better Services\n",
      "Use the benefit of downtime to create new products and better services and to provide opportunities for your team to develop new skills. When the clients are ready, your team will also be ready to provide new and better services for your clients! - Cindy Lamir, Impact Business Coaches\n",
      "18. Encourage And Allow Employees To Take More PTO\n",
      "Companies should be encouraging teams to take paid time off with family and friends during the summer months. Research shows that offering sabbaticals is the best way to get people to return to the office refreshed, more grateful and more productive than they were before they left. So, organizations should allow more time off in the summer so that employees come back refreshed and do their best work. - Carmelina Piedra, CareerCoachingPro\n",

      "Amid a slew of allegations of physical and emotional abuse against romantic partners and toxicity on film sets, Jonathan Majors’ lawyers say his “Method acting”—an immersive acting process that some swear by, but critics say can be bothersome and disruptive for coworkers—may have been misconstrued as rudeness on film sets.\n",
      "Jonathan Majors will appear in court in August after being charged with assault and aggravated ... [+] harassment. Hope he doesn’t stay “in character.”Cindy Ord/VF23/Getty Images for Vanity Fair\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Facts\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Method acting, also known as “The Method,” based on the early 1900s teachings of Russian director Konstantin Stanislavski and popularized in the United States by director Lee Strasberg, is a technique in which actors “use their physical, mental and emotional self in the creation of a character” to achieve an authentic performance, according to the Lee Strasberg Institute.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some celebrated Method acting performances include Strasberg student Robert De Niro’s work in Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, for the latter of which he gained 60 pounds to play a retired boxer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The modern understanding of Method acting has diverted from Stanislavski’s original teachings, according to i-D Magazine, which reported that Method acting is now associated with never breaking character and going to great lengths to fully inhabit characters, which has become popularized by the media.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some modern Method actors who choose to live as their characters on- and off-camera have garnered criticism for disruptive on-set behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jared Leto’s Method techniques have frequently made headlines, including an instance while filming Suicide Squad (2016), in which he starred as the Joker, when he sent co-stars Margot Robbie and Viola Davis a live rat and a dead pig, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Other infamous Method acting techniques include Leonardo DiCaprio sleeping in an animal carcass for The Revenant and Daniel Day-Lewis being pushed around in a wheelchair and spoon-fed by the crew of My Left Foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some non-Method actors who have worked with Method actors say their process makes the work environment more difficult, like Martin Freeman, who called his Man on the Moon co-star Jim Carrey’s Method acting process “self-aggrandizing, selfish” and “narcissistic.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Chief Critics\n",
      "In conversation with Jennifer Lopez for the Variety Studio: Actors on Actors series, Robert Pattinson said: “You only ever see people do the Method when they’re playing assholes. You never see someone being lovely to everyone while they’re really deep in character.” Lopez agreed, stating after years of making movies she often can’t wait to go home and let go of her characters. Sebastian Stan said Method acting “reads like an irresponsible, narcissistic thing. It reads like, ‘I’m afraid, and I want to torture everyone else because of it.’” Some have also criticized modern conceptions of Method acting for straying from Stanislavski’s teachings. Jon Bernthal said he doesn’t see the benefit of Method acting, but criticized how far the technique has strayed from Stanislavski’s teachings: “Making everybody call you by your character name and not showering for eight months was not what Stanislavski had in mind with the Method,” he told the Hollywood Reporter last year. Will Poulter criticized actors using Method acting “as an excuse for inappropriate behavior,” stating an actor’s process shouldn’t infringe on other people’s work environment. Jeremy Strong, star of the HBO hit Succession, made headlines for comments from co-workers about his intense process on the set (which he does not consider Method), which Kieran Culkin said “doesn’t help me” and Brian Cox called “f——- annoying,” adding he worries about what it does to him mentally.\n",
      "Contra\n",
      "Andrew Garfield defended Method acting last year, stating it is “not about being an asshole to everyone on set. It’s actually just about living truthfully under imagined circumstances.” He criticized misconceptions of Method acting and stated the technique helped him on the 2016 film Silence. Some stars, including Strong and Tony Kushner, defended Method actor Daniel Day-Lewis, who famously goes to great lengths for his roles, both of who worked with him on Lincoln. After a New Yorker article detailing Strong’s immersive acting process went viral, Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway defended his process. “When we talk about process, when we talk about intensity, when we talk about Method, when we talk about all this stuff, it’s all good to me. Nothing ever strikes me as weird,” Hathaway said.\n",
      "Key Background\n",
      "Majors, who maintains he is innocent, was arrested in March on charges of strangulation, assault and harassment of a 30-year-old woman, who referred to Majors as her partner in text messages shared with TMZ by Majors’ attorney Priya Chaudry. Multiple alleged abuse victims of Majors have since come forward and cooperated with legal authorities, and Majors was subsequently dropped by talent agency Entertainment 360 and PR firm The Lede Co. He also lost several film roles, including the upcoming film adaptation of the Walter Mosley novel The Man in My Basement, in which he was supposed to star and serve as executive producer, as well as an Otis Redding biopic. Majors appeared in court in June for a hearing in which his trial date was set for August 3. A Rolling Stone investigation published Thursday, based on interviews with more than 40 sources granted anonymity, alleges that Majors physically abused one romantic partner, emotionally abused two romantic partners and treated crew members on film sets poorly. Majors’ attorney denied the allegations raised in the Rolling Stone article. “Everyone who has worked with Mr. Majors knows that he employs an immersive Method acting style, and while that can be misconstrued as rudeness at times, those who know Mr. Majors and work in the industry have attested to his dedication to his craft as well as his kindness,” his lawyer Dustin Pusch told IndieWire.\n",

      "watch nowVIDEO3:2603:26Gay men face more challenges and higher costs to start familySquawk BoxBret Shuford and Stephen Hanna knew from early on in their relationship they wanted to raise a child together. But the married couple didn't think a biological child was a possibility.As freelancers in the creative arts, Shuford and Hanna don't always see steady income, even when working on Broadway. The Houston-based couple, known as the \"Broadway Husbands,\" thought having a child with a donor egg and gestational carrier \"seemed like it was something that was only available to people who were very wealthy,\" said Shuford, 44.It's a safe assumption that having a child with a surrogate, now most often called a gestational carrier, is cost-prohibitive. While expenses vary widely due to a number of medical and legal factors, \"the average cost of surrogacy in America has gone from $75,000 five years ago, to anywhere between $150,000 and $250,000 today,\" according to Dr. Brian Levine, a reproductive endocrinologist who founded surrogacy matching platform Nodal.More from Personal Finance:How LGBTQ+ seniors can tackle their special caregiving challengesFinancial advisor: Here are 4 important money tips for parents with young kidsTeenagers are in high demand as summer hiring surge gets under wayIn the U.S., there are only about 5,000 successful surrogacy journeys per year, Nodal estimates.\"That's only about 8% of met need,\" Levine said. \"In plain English, 92% of the people that dream of starting or growing or completing a family with surrogacy will not be able to do so in America due to the sheer time and cost constraints that are there today.\"Why gay male couples face higher costsAlon Rivel, left, with his family.Courtesy Alon RivelAlon Rivel always wanted to be a father. \"As I grew up, I realized I was gay,\" said Rivel, 34. \"So I thought, this will never happen for me. I don't have the money, but I wanted it desperately.\"\"We were shocked when we started to look into [having a biological child] and realized nothing is covered by insurance unless you can prove that you're infertile,\" said Rivel, who lives in Arlington, Massachusetts. He and his husband believed that \"this is complete discrimination on the insurance company's part because we are gay men.\"\"It is not a choice,\" Rivel added. \"We were born this way and, thus, we are actually infertile.\"Experts say the demand for surrogacy relationships has grown since same-sex marriage became legal in the U.S. in 2015.Gay male couples typically face a more expensive journey, as surrogacy or adoption are their primary choices. In contrast, same-sex female couples are often able to carry pregnancies to term on their own, though they may possibly have to pay for donor sperm and fertilization.Sadly, we do see in some states that there are laws that discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community.Betsy Campbellchief engagement officer for Resolve: The National Infertility AssociationDonor eggs are exponentially more expensive than donor sperm largely because the egg retrieval process is more invasive and complicated. While costs, again, vary wildly, donor eggs and the associated costs can range between $20,000 and $60,000, according to fertility marketplace GoStork, while donor sperm can be from as little as several hundred dollars to around $1,000.Donor eggs, meanwhile, are only one of many expenses.Shuford and Hanna's health insurance covered only the tests done on their sperm samples. Their remaining expenses, they estimate, ran between $150,000 and $180,000. That included around $40,000 for donor eggs, the medical costs to create, store, test and freeze embryos, medical insurance and out-of-pocket medical costs for their gestational carrier, her compensation, and other expenses.The couple used savings, credit cards and high-interest loans to cover that tab. Rivel and his husband's journey to parenthood ultimately cost $220,000.\"We're taking money away from our child's college fund,\" he said. \"We're taking money away from our mortgage.\"\"Compared to [many of] our friends, our baseline is $200,000 below where they started,\" Rivel added.Employer fertility benefits offer limited helpMore employers are starting to offer fertility benefits, often through a specialized fertility benefits manager such as Kindbody, Carrot, Progyny or Maven. In 2022, 40% of U.S. employers offered some type of fertility coverage, up from 30% in 2020, according to the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans.Fertility IQ, which keeps a workplace index of employer fertility benefits, found the average amount of fertility coverage in 2021 was $36,000 per lifetime, flat from the year before.But while more companies are offering fertility benefits, many of these packages are limited when it comes to covering what's needed to build families using non-traditional methods. Almost two-thirds, 63%, of LGBTQ+ people plan to use assisted reproductive technology, foster care or adoption to become parents, according to a survey by Family Equality.Yet fewer than half of employers offering fertility benefits provided any benefits for adoption, and only about 10% provided benefits related to surrogacy, according to a 2021 survey from Resolve: The National Infertility Association and health-care consultancy Mercer. And state laws requiring employers of a certain size to offer fertility benefits often leave out coverage for third-party reproduction such as a gestational carrier or the purchase of donor eggs or donor sperm.\"I honestly believe that employers don't realize there is a gap in their benefits. And they often don't know this until an employee points that out,\" said Betsy Campbell, chief engagement officer for Resolve.She said many employers she speaks to have \"the best intentions\" but don't understand how gestational surrogacy works or how family building benefits fall short.Will Porteous, 39, became a father through gestational surrogacy before joining Maven as its chief growth officer. He and his husband tabulated their parenthood path cost at close to $175,000. \"No employer in the entire country that I'm aware of offers anything greater than $75,000 a year, and so that only covers a portion.\" Will Porteous, right, with his husband, Doug, and their son, Walter.Courtesy Will PorteousBut Porteous, who lives in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, said full coverage isn't necessarily what LGBTQ+ couples want to see. \"The expectation is to have equitable support to your other co-workers and seeing that your employer cares about that journey,\" he said.That employer support, Porteous said, \"really means a lot and it shows that you as an employer care about your employee, regardless of how they're going to build their family.\"Fertility benefits can help recruit, retain talentWhile fertility benefits manager Progyny's first clients were largely West Coast \"Silicon Valley-type\" businesses, according to CEO Pete Anevski, it now works with employers in 40 industries.\"There's a flywheel effect happening,\" he said, with more companies realizing benefits need to include family-building coverage \"to be competitive, to attract and retain talent in what is still a tight labor market, an inflationary economy, even with concerns around a looming recession.\" Fertility benefits manager Carrot said it has around 800 corporate clients and 80% of those offer their employees a benefit for surrogacy. \"We have seen an increase in surrogacy claims year over year at about 250%,\" said CEO Tammy Sun. Offering these types of benefits can be key factors for a company when job candidates are making decisions about employment, said Taryn Branca, chief revenue officer at Kindbody.\"I can't tell you how many of our clients will call us, we will get on the phone with potential candidates that they're recruiting, or we will provide information to support that recruit coming there because they are asking for very specific information before they'll accept the offer: if they have surrogacy benefits, if they have donor benefits,\" she said.More than half of respondents in a new Progyny survey of LGBTQ+ community members said they are actively looking to build their families. Of that population, 79% would consider leaving their current job for one that offers better fertility and family-building benefits, and 80% would consider taking a second job to receive those benefits.\"This is not a 'nice to have,' this is a 'need to have' benefit,\" Anevski said.Rivel's husband is an early employee at Massachusetts-based Beam Therapeutics. At Rivel's insistence, he asked his human resources department to look into including surrogacy benefits. Eventually, the company added a surrogacy reimbursement benefit, which at the time Rivel and his husband used it was worth $10,000. While $10,000 was a small dent in the couple's $220,000 surrogacy journey, Rivel said it's better than nothing. \"It's really admirable that they have it,\" he said. \"I think it's a really smart benefit for recruiting more people.\"Adoption also comes with high costs, risksAdoption is certainly another family-building option. \"It's not for everyone ... it's not without its costs, and the laws vary by state,\" Resolve's Campbell said. \"Sadly, we do see in some states that there are laws that discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community, so that's definitely a consideration.\"The average nonfoster-system adoption costs between $25,000 and $60,000, according to the Child Welfare Information Gateway. As with surrogacy relationships, the adopting parents cover related expenses for all parties, from medical to legal, plus living expenses if a match is made in advance of a birth. And, of course, there are no guarantees.Shuford and Hanna decided adoption wasn't a path for them. \"There's a lot of risks involved that we weren't willing to take,\" Hanna said. \"We had heard of stories involving birth mothers changing their minds, and children having birth defects that without [genetic embryo testing] weren't known.\"'It was totally worth it'Stephen Hanna, left, with his husband, Bret Shuford, and their son, Maverick.Courtesy Bret Shuford and Stephen HannaLike many gestational carrier stories, Shuford and Hanna's was far from easy or straightforward.Their first carrier dropped out of the process shortly before the embryo transfer was scheduled to take place but well after contracts had been signed and medical assessments and travel had occurred. The Covid-19 pandemic delayed the process with their second gestational carrier; then, after the first embryo transfer, the pregnancy ended in a devastating miscarriage. The second embryo transfer worked, and their surrogate gave birth to their son, Maverick, in 2022.\"So many times, we felt very excluded,\" Shuford said. \"We want to be able to have a family and raise our child and have that child be biologically related to us, and we have a right to do that, and we have a right to feel seen and validated in that process.\"But for Shuford, \"in the end, it was totally worth it.\"\"I mean, Maverick is amazing,\" he added. \"And we're so lucky to have a healthy baby and also having someone like Crystal, our surrogate who carried our child.\"\"I don't know that I've ever experienced that kind of love in my life,\" Shuford said. \"So it's really a powerful experience.\" \n",

Spirit makes fuselages for Boeing's 737 Max and pylons for Airbus A220s at the plant.\"In light of the decision to strike by Spirit AeroSystems employees represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers today, Spirit will suspend factory production prior to the expiration of the contract,\" Spirit said.The issue comes as Boeing is trying to ramp up production of 737 Max planes. Boeing has some Spirit-made fuselages in inventory but declined to say how many or what the impact of the production halt would be on Boeing's output of 737s.\"I want to encourage all of us to stay focused on our task at hand, which is to continue to build and deliver the finest airplanes in the world,\" Stan Deal, CEO of Boeing's commercial airplane unit, said in a note to employees on Thursday. \"We will update all of you as we gain further insights from our partners at Spirit.\"Spirit fell more than 9% on Thursday, while Boeing's shed more than 3%.The production halt began with the first shift on Thursday, two days before the contract covering roughly 6,000 workers is set to expire. The strike is scheduled to begin just after midnight on Saturday, the union said.\"The IAM's dedicated and hardworking membership at Spirit AeroSystems has worked without fail during tumultuous times, including a pandemic that saw everything grind to a halt,\" the union said in a statement. \"Most of our members have concluded that the company's offer is unacceptable.\"The union said that 79% of workers voted against the contract and 85% voted for the strike.Rickey Wallace, general vice president of IAM's 14-state southern territory said the union wants to get back to the bargaining table as soon as possible.\"It's our goal to get an agreement,\" he said. \n",

      "My relationship with wellness is more complicated than running into a guy I ghosted at an office party. I began my journey in 2017 as a lot of people do: dressed in Lululemon and sipping green juice on my way to a yoga class. (I had chosen trap classes because I was much more comfortable hearing “Mouth Full of Golds” during child’s pose than risking stepping on a white woman’s yoga mat.) Soon, wellness became a capitalistic pursuit I held near. I loved grabbing a blue spirulina smoothie while out on a run — but only dressed in head-to-toe Nike gear. Lulu was for the gym and yoga. I became obsessed with rings, namely, closing the ones on my Apple Watch. \n",
      "By 2020, after spending thousands of dollars on this journey without seeing any measurable improvement in my mental health — which people do experience from wellness efforts — I began to interrogate why I expected this effort to cure my anxiety and depression. I was sidelined by the coronavirus pandemic and, like many others, began to question what actually mattered to me. Still, I did yoga, strength trained, cycled, and meditated at home to keep myself mentally afloat during the pandemic and during the antiracism protests over the murder of George Floyd, an immensely triggering moment for Black folks. Having a routine was helpful until it wasn’t. \n",
      "By 2022, I was experiencing weekly panic attacks that slowly increased to I-don’t-know-how-many-days a week. I wasn’t sleeping or moving much farther than from my bed to the couch. When I was eating, I wasn’t choosing nutritious foods. I’d run out of motivation to care for myself — and all of it felt like it shouldn’t be happening to me because I should be tougher.  \n",
      "Mainstream wellness was, to lean further into cliches, a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. I was actively pursuing better mental and physical health, a key piece of a wellness journey, but I wasn’t taking the time to establish what felt good to me. I was trying to fit into the trendiness of wellness, and I desperately wanted the freedom it proclaimed I could have if I bought enough stuff. Nowadays, I define wellness as, “Doing what feels good and aligns with what I believe I need in this moment.”\n",
      "My burnout story is a quintessential narrative among Black women. Many of us have been raised to be “strong” despite the systemic factors that make such an ideal impossible to uphold. The Strong Black Woman trope demands that we swallow our pain for the greater good of others, and it comes with grave psychological consequences. It can make us more susceptible to depression, anxiety, and feelings of isolation. For some Black women, we rarely forgive ourselves for our mistakes and relentlessly seek to meet others’ expectations. This is more harrowing when we consider that stress compounds. Besides causing headaches, chest pain, fatigue, and stomach issues, heightened stress levels can make sleeping impossible. Your breathing can quicken. You could develop high blood pressure, a weakened immune system, anxiety, depression, Type 2 diabetes, or memory loss — adverse health outcomes that Black people are more likely to experience. \n",
      "The systemic conditions that prevent Black women from being able to take proper care of ourselves is one of our nation’s most significant health injustices. And to add insult to our spiritual injury, wellness practices, which can be a useful tool to fight poor mental health, are presented to us through a Eurocentric, capitalist lens, encouraging us to spend money many of us don’t have on products we don’t need to care for ourselves. \n",
      "I discussed these conditions and the role wellness plays in navigating them with DeJa Love, the CEO of the Black Women’s Wellness Agency. Love’s agency supports Black women who are stressed, burnt out, and overwhelmed by connecting them to Black women wellness providers. This could be a yoga teacher, meditation or life coach, personal trainer, or any non-clinical wellness service that helps manage stress. \n",
      "“We have to go deeper because the world in which we’re living in, it’s not sustainable for us to keep at this pace,” Love says. “I really view this as a fierce urgency, as life or death. When Black birthing persons are dying at three times the rates of white folks, that’s a crisis. We are dying, across the board, at higher rates. This is why it’s so important.” \n",
      "This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. \n",
      "Explain your personal approach to wellness. Is it more spiritual? Or is it more political? \n",
      "For Black women, our wellness is infinite. That it is not a $200 yoga mat or yoga pants. Since, especially in the mainstream context of the United States — which is incredibly racist with white supremacist undertones — wellness is generally capitalistic. It’s about the doing, and the purchasing. \n",
      "Infinite wellness is knowing that maybe wellness for me in one moment is sitting in silence, sensory deprivation, not on social, not logged in, but sitting, connecting to breath, connecting to the divine spirit that guides us, whatever folks identify with. In the context of America, wellness is rest. It’s challenging a toxic grind culture that tells us we need to constantly produce, that we’re not enough, that we’re not doing enough. I’m guided by Tricia Hersey and her work. She leads The Nap Ministry, and her book Rest Is Resistance has really shifted my paradigm and informs a lot of what I view as wellness.\n",
      "What are some of those white supremacist undertones to wellness? \n",
      "It’s really this notion of, “I have to do something. I have to purchase something. I have to buy something. I have to keep performing.” And that can look like, “I need to buy the expensive mask. I need to buy expensive face serums. I need to go to the gym classes.” It’s still a perpetuation of grind culture and hyper-productivity. Whereas the Black Woman’s Wellness Agency and I challenge that and say, “Black women, you are enough by just being!” It seems so simple, but the brilliance is in the simplicity of being — not doing. Wellness is shifting our minds away from what we have been indoctrinated with, such as: “I have to be a certain weight, I have to look a certain way, I have to have this.” No. We have to be on the path of unlearning.\n",
      "Those are some of the undertones. It’s about this aesthetic, and that’s what we get. But wellness is not an aesthetic. Wellness is being connected to our breath, our bodies, and calming the mental fluctuations that happen constantly. \n",
      "This multibillion-dollar wellness industry that says you have to drink this or take this supplement or be in this intricate yoga posture just creates more work. \n",
      "Why isn’t wellness binary for Black women? I was looking on your website, and I saw that. I think I know what that means, but I’m very, very intrigued.\n",
      "It’s not binary because we, as Black women, are so robust. We have had to be. We’ve had to be the heads of households, to be cooks and cleaners, to raise children and make sure the finances are handled — we’re constantly wearing so many hats. Our healing and our wellness are not going to be boxed in. It can’t be, because we have to do so much. \n",
      "Black women are the largest demographic of advanced degree holders and business owners post-2020. We’re doing so much, and that’s why we’re proponents of wellness being whatever it is you need. \n",
      "If wellness is saying, “I’m just really tired, and I don’t need to push through,” then that’s wellness. If wellness is saying, “My family is expecting me to do something, and I say I can’t do that because I need to uphold my boundaries, and I can’t keep pouring from this empty cup,” then that’s wellness. That’s the journey that I’m still on. We’re all still on it. \n",
      "It has to be full-spectrum and incredibly inclusive. It has to counter the mainstream approach to wellness — the skinny white woman in Lululemon doing an intricate yoga posture. That is not true wellness; that is a capitalistic approach that we have been fed, and we have to keep pushing back because that image may not serve us. Now, we are not a monolith, so maybe that image serves some Black women. I know for many, though, that it does not.\n",
      "One thing that I think most Black women can all relate to is the pressure to fit into these spaces, whether it’s work or a yoga studio, where you’re the only Black person there, and people are looking at you crazy. So when we reclaim and reframe wellness — meaning we stop looking at it through this billion-dollar lens — how do we reconnect with our power? \n",
      "It’s multifaceted. It will take many different approaches. One of them is going for a walk and doing a walking meditation, not having your AirPods in, just listening to the sounds of nature so you can get out of your head and connect with the many thoughts that are going to come into your mind. I don’t want to demonize social media. It’s an amazing tool that connects us, but part of reclaiming is having healthy sabbaticals from social [media]. \n",
      "I’m also a proponent of therapy. Therapy helps us be introspective. \n",
      "Another thing that has helped me is being able to be free. Business ownership has allowed me to feel free. I’ve had an 18-year career in many business sectors, and within all of those sectors, you become indoctrinated, and your truth gets stifled by the dominant group. And even those who look like me can fall into assimilation and respectability. I speak unapologetically, and many people do not connect, and that’s fine. I’ve had to make peace with the fact that I may not get all the business contracts, or I may not gross the revenue that I want. But I can sleep at night knowing that I am speaking for Black women, that I am challenging inequities, the status quo, and a society that perpetuates it.\n",
      "You pointed out that when Black women really start taking care of ourselves, prioritizing our needs, and start centering our well-being, we lose people. It’s always been very interesting to me that when a Black woman starts thinking about her well-being versus how she can be in service to everyone else, people start dropping off. \n",
      "Earlier today, when I was on my walk, I was thinking about when we’re on journeys of evolution. I don’t want to be the same DeJa I was three years ago, a year ago. I want to be evolving, and learning, and there are folks that will not be there on that journey … it’s hard sometimes. It’s always the folks you don’t expect, the people who were always there. And that just hurts harder. Part of that evolution is releasing that attachment. And the folks that connect to me will find me. I will build a new community. \n",
      "It’s like my granny used to say, “Everybody can’t come.” Speaking of her — a Black woman who absolutely prioritized her well-being after raising three generations of her family — how does wellness help Black women thrive?\n",
      "It helps us because we are able to get reconnected with self. When I’m putting on my public health hat, our life expectancy is reduced in this white supremacist, very racist society. From medical racism in health care, housing, education, transportation — every facet that we intersect with has a huge impact on our outcome. Every facet of being in this country challenges us. Wellness helps us get back to our center when all of these forces that create the inequities we live in challenge us.\n",
      "Sometimes we will question ourselves. We forget the confidence, the power, the self-esteem, the self-efficacy because we have been metaphorically beaten down by all of these systems.\n",
      "We even have to combat the complicity of folks in our own communities and other white-adjacent folks of color. I know that’s a provocative notion. Black people and other folks of color can uphold white supremacy because we’re all stewed in the same society. So people get surprised, for instance, that a Black physician can perpetuate harm to their Black patients. They have been trained in racist medical schools, so they can perpetuate what they have been taught. That’s why wellness is so important. Wellness is whatever a Black woman needs. We know what we need for our healing, to feel grounded, to feel at peace, to feel centered. That is crucial as we navigate this society that we operate in.\n",
      "How does taking care of ourselves challenge hustle culture? Sometimes this strikes me as a conundrum. We’re trying to get out of this capitalistic dynamic of wellness, but we live in a capitalistic society, and we have to survive. And sometimes, for certain wellness practices, you have to buy something. It feels very sticky sometimes to see taking care of yourself as a challenge to capitalism when we live in a society where it’s so deeply entrenched.\n",
      "It’s so important because grind culture is insidious. We are not even aware of the hold that grind culture has on us. That’s why stepping back transforms. \n",
      "Again, I’m not immune from it. That’s why I’m so intentional with my unlearning, even as a business owner, challenging myself to not just push through. I’ll say: “DeJa, you’ve been up for how many hours? You’ve been in how many back-to-back meetings? Go out, take a walk, do a guided meditation, go do some yoga, just do something!” \n",
      "I want to see a world where all Black women, and I use that term inclusively, are well. Where we’re not burnt out, where we’re not overwhelmed, where we’re not stressed, where employers don’t undervalue our contribution — they’re not even paying us the full dollar! We’re getting what? Sixty-seven cents on the dollar? And working twice as hard to prove ourselves. That is the encapsulation of grind culture and being unwell. \n",

      "      Most news outlets make their money through advertising or subscriptions. But when it comes to what we’re trying to do at Vox, there are a couple of big issues with relying on ads and subscriptions to keep the lights on.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, advertising dollars go up and down with the economy. We often only know a few months out what our advertising revenue will be, which makes it hard to plan ahead.\n",

      "Out of the millions of fungal species in the world, only a few hundred can make people sick. Coccidioides is one of them — and it lives in desert dust. Microscopic spores are kicked up when the ground is disturbed; if inhaled, they can cause an infection known as Valley fever. Most people recover without ever knowing they had it, but others will experience far more intense symptoms, ranging from pneumonia to meningitis. Coccidioides is also really good at eating … meat. \n",
      "Fortunately, this fungus is typically only found in the southwestern US, parts of Mexico, and Central and South America — and cases are rare. But unfortunately, that range is expanding quickly. Scientists are racing to understand exactly why, because even though this fungus has existed for millennia, there are still tons of unanswered questions about how it lives both in the desert and in people.\n",

      "\n",
      "A few users have commented that they now need to charge their phone twice a day, with one noting that their handset loses battery life, while idle, 40 percent faster than before the update.

      "Other users have also complained about new connectivity issues, with their handsets struggling to maintain a consistent cellular connection—forcing them to restart or toggle airplane mode. There are several other complaints about worse general performance on the Pixel 4a 5G, Bluetooth connectivity issues and features like select text not working properly. These problems appear to affect a wide range of devices, but the main concerns are based around excessive battery drain and inconsistent network connectivity.\n",

      "On the connectivity side, a fix for an issue that stopped eSIMs from activating for the Pixel 7 range—and broad improvement to network connectivity stability—was included in the update.

      "A \"Sold\" sign outside a home in the Toll Brothers Regency Ranch at Folsom housing community in Folsom, California, US, on Tuesday, May 16, 2023.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThis report is from today's CNBC Daily Open, our new, international markets newsletter. CNBC Daily Open brings investors up to speed on everything they need to know, no matter where they are. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.What you need to know todayStocks reboundMajor U.S. indexes rose Tuesday in a tech-fueled rally, shaking off their multiday losing streaks. However, U.S. futures dipped slightly in overnight trading. European markets traded higher too. The pan-European Stoxx 600 inched up 0.05%, breaking its six-day losing streak. That's partly thanks to a 16% surge in shares of fintech company Wise, which reported income growth of 73% year on year.Recession warningThe U.S. will slip into recession in the fourth quarter this year, and will continue languishing in it for 2024, according to HSBC Asset Management. Additionally, the euro zone will join the U.S. in seeing its economy contract next year. The silver lining of this forecast: Inflation will fall quickly, and HSBC expects the Federal Reserve to cut rates by the end of this year.Higher rates for longerEuropean Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said inflation in the euro zone is still \"too high and is set to remain so for too long.\" In May, headline inflation was 6.1% for the region, lower than April's reading of 7% but still three times the ECB's target of 2%. Lagarde warned that it's unlikely the ECB will pause rates, let alone cut them, anytime soon.Unity's A.I. marketplaceUnity shares jumped over 15% to touch $42.38 per share after the company launched a marketplace for artificial intelligence software. The company develops a game engine — also called Unity — that allows users to produce games for phones and consoles. With the new marketplace, users can choose software from other companies to generate AI graphics, text, voice and so on.[PRO] Seth Klarman on marketsLegendary investor Seth Klarman of Baupost Group spoke with CNBC Tuesday in an exclusive interview. Two highlights: Klarman pointed out one of the most common mistakes regular investors commit when buying index funds and identified a \"hunting ground\" for investors looking for opportunities. Watch the full interview here.The bottom lineRecession, recession, recession. The calls are getting so loud you'd still hear them even if you covered your ears.Here's Joseph Little, global chief strategist at HSBC Asset Management: \"\"The coming recession scenario will be more like the early 1990s recession, with our central scenario being a 1-2% drawdown in GDP.\"JPMorgan Chase's top strategist Marko Kolanovic: \"We expect a more challenging backdrop for stocks … given the decelerating economy and a likely recession starting in 4Q23/1Q24.\"Baupost Group Chief Executive Officer Seth Klarman: \"The goal of the Fed is to reduce the heat in the economy, and one way to do that is to trigger some kind of recession … so maybe it's an early 2024 event.\"Yet fresh economic data from the U.S. showed a resilient economy that, with luck, might eventually defy those predictions.Consumer confidence rose more than anticipated to hit the highest level since January 2022; the proportion of respondents expecting a recession declined four percentage points (though it's still high at 69.3%).The housing market, generally an early indicator of a downturn, also showed surprising strength. New home sales in May rose 12.2% from April — economists were expecting a drop of 1.2%. Home prices in April increased 1.3% month over month, according to the Case-Shiller index, a closely watched gauge.Demand for durable goods, which are typically big purchases like televisions and transportation equipment that require long-term payments, accelerated 1.7% in May. That's faster than April's 1.2% increase and far more than the Dow Jones estimate of a 1% decline.All those data show that the U.S. consumer isn't yet buckling under higher interest rates and (ostensibly) dimmer economic prospects.And if Wolfe Research's Chief Investment Strategist Chris Senyek's expectation for \"the U.S. consumer to be the #1 driver of the economic outlook\" proves right, then that strength in consumers might allow the U.S. economy to fend off a recession, despite a chorus of voices predicting one.\n",
