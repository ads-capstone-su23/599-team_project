      "Over five months after Julian Sands went missing during a solo hike in California, local police have announced the ongoing search for the actor will continue in a \"limited capacity.\"The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Office released a statement Monday on the department's continued efforts to locate the \"A Room with a View\" actor.Sands, 65, was reported missing on Jan. 13 while hiking a trail on Mount Baldy in Southern California, San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Gloria Huerta said at the time. Authorities' search efforts, both on the ground and by air, have been paused and resumed based on a series of storms that has created dangerous mountain conditions in the area.On Saturday, the sheriff's office conducted another search for Sands involving over 80 search and rescue volunteers, deputies and staff. Two helicopters helped search teams reach remote areas of Mount Baldy, and drone crews searched areas inaccessible to hikers on the ground.Despite the department's efforts, Sands was still not found. Some areas of the mountain \"remain inaccessible due to extreme alpine conditions,\" the statement explained. \"Multiple areas include steep terrain and ravines, which still have 10 plus feet of ice and snow.\"While Sands' missing person case remains \"active,\" \"search efforts will continue in a limited capacity,\" the department said. The sheriff's department has conducted eight searches, including both ground and air, to locate the actor since he went missing in January, logging over 500 volunteer searcher hours.Sands' family has expressed gratitude to authorities for their \"heroic\" search efforts.\"Our heartfelt thanks to the compassionate members of the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department who are coordinating the search for our beloved Julian,\" the actor's family said in a statement in late January. \"We are deeply touched by the outpouring of love and support.”Sands starred opposite Helena Bonham Carter in \"A Room With a View,\" the 1985 British romance from director James Ivory. He also had major roles in in 1989's \"Warlock,\" 1990's \"Arachnophobia,\" 1991's \"Naked Lunch,\" 1993's \"Boxing Helena\" and 1995's \"Leaving Las Vegas.\"Contributing: Naledi Ushe, Edward SegarraJohn Malkovich:Actor talks 'close' relationship with Julian Sands, actor's disappearance \n",

      "'Rage giving' prompted by the end of Roe has dropped off, abortion access groups sayThe windfall of donations that abortion access groups received following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade one year ago hasn't lastedByTHALIA BEATY and GLENN GAMBOA Associated PressJune 24, 2023, 3:10 AMFILE - Abortion-rights activists protest outside the Supreme Court in Washington, Saturday, June 25, 2022. Abortion access groups who received a windfall of donations following the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade one year ago say those emergency grants have ended and individual and foundation giving has dropped off. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)The Associated PressThe “ rage giving ” did not last. Abortion access groups who received a windfall of donations following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade one year ago say those emergency grants have ended and individual and foundation giving has dropped off. After the Dobbs decision, some major funders of abortion access also have ended or shifted funding from organizations working in states where abortion is now banned, said Naa Amissah-Hammond, senior director of grantmaking with Groundswell Fund, which funds grassroots groups organizing for reproductive justice.Women’s health and foster care nonprofits, who expected increased demand in areas where access to abortion has been eliminated or restricted, say they also haven’t seen increased support.Holly Calvasina said her experience as director of development at the reproductive health clinic CHOICES in Memphis, Tennessee, might provide an explanation. Like many working in the reproductive rights sector, Calvasina said she tried to prepare for the increase in need, even before a draft of the Supreme Court decision was leaked in May last year. While some funders saw the writing on the wall and stepped up support, others wanted to wait and see. \"I think (that) really speaks to kind of a fundamental issue with philanthropy and responding to an emergent crisis,\" Calvasina said. \"Philanthropy moves really slowly and human rights crises unfold quickly.” The rollercoaster of giving also showed up for CHOICES in the $150,000 in donations to their annual spring appeal last year. That’s up from $2,000 in 2021. This year, the appeal raised $40,000. Organizations in states where abortion has been banned or limited have needed to pivot, said Marsha Jones, executive director of The Afiya Center, based in Dallas. Her organization used donations received after the Dobbs decision to expand its birthing center, but she said funders are less interested in supporting maternal health than they were in supporting advocacy and practical support for abortions. She argues, as she has for years, that supporting reproductive justice is more than supporting abortion access.“It is literally people wanting to choose full bodily autonomy,\" she said of those choosing to carry a pregnancy to term and others who do not. Data on last year's charitable giving to any sector is hard to come by. The pandemic has slowed the public release of donor reports to the IRS, though a delay of up to two years was typical even before COVID-19 hit. Donations to human services and public society benefit organizations, sectors that could include abortion access nonprofits, both declined in 2022, while donations to health organizations increased 5%, which is actually a decline when adjusted for inflation, according to the Giving USA report released last week.But a special layer of opacity exists around funding for abortion access. Many donors fund anonymously, sometimes requiring grantees not to publicly disclose the source. The largest historic funder, The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, eventually makes gifts public through tax filings, but the organization does not comment on support for abortion access and did not respond to questions about whether or how its funding strategy changed in response to the Dobbs decision. Another large funder, The David and Lucile Packard Foundation, said it is shifting its grantmaking after Dobbs. It stopped funding sex education programs in schools and ended funding for abortion services that closed due to new laws. The foundation also added $14.1 million in funding last year to “shore up providers in safe haven states,” and to help people find and access abortion care.The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation said it provides steady support to grantees in all states to fund abortion care where it remains legal or advocacy against bans.In general, giving to organizations specifically serving women and girls represents less than 2% of all donations, according to a research project of the Women’s Philanthropy Institute at Indiana University’s Lilly Family School of Philanthropy.Calvasina thinks anonymous funding, especially from the largest foundations, perpetuates inequality within the movement. Others in the sector said donors have many reasons for wanting to be anonymous, including to avoid being targeted by groups opposing abortion. One measure of the potential amount of funding available to reproductive health organizations is the extent of gifts from donor-advised funds hosted by the Silicon Valley Community Foundation to Planned Parenthood affiliates across the country. Those donations exceeded $98 million in 2022, according to data from Candid, a nonprofit that compiles information about charitable giving. The foundation declined to speak about the gifts, citing its policy not to comment on DAF grants. Seeing a drop in giving after a major event is not that unusual, said Una Osili, associate dean for research and international programs at the Lilly Family School.“If you think about the decision to give, whether it’s to a natural disaster or crisis, people hear about it and they want to participate to make a difference,” Osili said. Danielle Gletow, founder and executive director at One Simple Wish, a nonprofit connecting donors with foster children who have specific requests, said people are seeking out groups like hers offering direct support. But she worries that abortion access restrictions may further strain the foster care system. In Texas, where the state's child welfare program is so overwhelmed that children sometimes sleep in office buildings, foster care workers fear the state's strict laws on abortion may force women to have children for whom they cannot care, adding to the foster children population.“I don’t think it’s possible to break anything worse when it’s already broken, if I’m being honest,” Gletow said. “This is a system that’s incredibly broken.”Philanthropic support has surged to states such as New Mexico, which passed laws protecting access to abortion and shielding abortion providers while bordering Texas and Oklahoma, where abortion is now banned. A coalition of local groups publicly asked incoming funders and groups to coordinate with them as recently as February.Charlene Bencomo, executive director of Bold Futures, a leader of the coalition, said they ask new providers to accept Medicaid, which can cover abortion in the state, and to offer reproductive health services outside of abortion care.“We continue to look for a higher quality of care, a better quality of care for our folks in New Mexico and for those who need to come here to access care that they cannot in their home state,” Bencomo said. Amissah-Hammond, of the Groundswell Fund, said she's waiting to see if funders who responded with emergency or one-time grants last year will continue to fund abortion access over the long term. For funders concerned about legal liabilities, she suggested they offer general operating support, rather than project-based grants, and accept updates over the phone. “We’re learning a lot from our peer funders who have been funding in global contexts,\" she said. \"Where work for reproductive rights, health and justice has been criminalized for a long time and where LGBTQ rights has been criminalized and work, frankly, for democracy has been criminalized.” ___Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

      "Quavo and Offset came together for their first public performance in years in an emotional tribute to Takeoff at Sunday’s BET Awards. Together the trio formed the influential hip-hop group Migos, but split in 2021. Takeoff was fatally shot during a private party held in Houston, Texas, in November 2022.  Quavo and Offset began their tribute with the single “Hotel Lobby,” while an image of Takeoff was shown on the screen behind them. They then performed their 2016 hit, “Bad and Boujee.” Both men shared images and videos from their performance on social media. Their reunion was significant as the two had reportedly been estranged since Migos broke up two years ago. Takeoff and Quavo had formed the duo “Unc & Phew” and released their debut album, “Only Built for Infinity Links,” weeks before Takeoff was killed.  \n",

      "Ever since President Vladimir Putin gave the order for Russian troops to invade Ukraine, the international response has understandably focused on how best to end the land war. That has meant sending conventional military hardware – tanks, missile systems, artillery – and training Ukrainian soldiers.   Not bad for an organization France’s President Emmanuel Macron warned in 2019 was facing “brain death.” Russia’s aggression hasn’t been restricted to the battlefield. Even before the invasion, NATO officials noted a rise in non-conventional warfare aimed at Ukraine and other Western targets. Since the start of the war, disinformation, energy restrictions and cyberattacks on infrastructure have all been weaponized by the Kremlin to justify and advance its war.   “A weapon, by its broadest definition, is something that you can use to coerce someone into doing what you want them to do. You can put a gun to their head, you can blackmail them, you can spread disinformation to turn others against them or you can turn off the energy to their house,” David van Weel, NATO’s Assistant Secretary General for Emerging Security Challenges, told CNN. Those weapons are not only aimed at the target, in this case Ukraine. “Russia claims that NATO promised never to expand to the east after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. And although we’ve been debunking that for years, you see that this keeps coming back. And there’s definitely a percentage of our population that falls for this kind of disinformation,” van Weel said.     These sorts of attacks can have very real-world impact, van Weel explained, referencing a cyberattack that took out German wind farms last year. It is commonly accepted that energy security has been a key feature of the war in Ukraine, with Russia using energy as a weapon against Western allies.   Much of the Western focus since the start of the war has been on defense spending. It is no secret that the vast majority of NATO allies have for years fallen far short of their 2% target, something that has long infuriated officials at NATO’s Brussels HQ.  A common explanation as to why this happened is that in the post-Soviet era, Western countries became complacent, feeling that they had won the Cold War.   “Countries far away from invasion themselves felt that distance would lead security, and they could continue to ignore the growing urgency of investment in hard security,” said Keir Giles, a senior fellow at the London-based Chatham House think tank.   “Spending 2% of GDP on defence was supposed to be a baseline – the minimum credible level of defence budget. Over time, cynical countries who didn’t feel at risk pointed to the spending of 2% to claim that they were doing enough on defense. But in reality, there was no stipulation on what that 2% – even if they reached that threshold – was spent on, so it was never an indication of how prepared or useful they might be,” Giles added.    This inertia has also held back the West’s ability to deal with cyber and non-conventional threats from adversaries, including Russia and China. To those working in these areas, it came as no surprise that Russia had been so successful interfering in the elections of other nations or that China had so successfully spread disinformation in Western countries during the pandemic.   Peter Caddick-Adams, a former official NATO historian, explains that it is extremely difficult for nations not currently at war to behave as though they are. This war mentality is key when dealing with threats that are not boots on the ground, but are just as aggressive and exist in places that are harder to see.  “NATO could only go as fast as members were willing to invest. If you are a peacetime democracy, it’s very difficult to switch to that footing and counterattack your opponent’s non-conventional attacks. If you are not at war, there will be a limit on what you and your public are willing to spend on things they can’t see,” he told CNN.   While all eyes will be on whether or not Sweden becomes the 32nd country to join NATO at its summit next month, the collective defense alliance will also use its meeting to show that it’s prepared for its future.   It will announce the NATO Innovation Fund, a project that will bring 23 of NATO’s members together with private business in the technology sector. It will make the participating nations Limited Partners, meaning they will not seek majority stakes in companies and allow the companies to carry on working with other investors, including from outside NATO.   Why is an organization like NATO taking such a relaxed approach to developing technologies that will soon become so critical to national and international security?  “Innovation used to come from the defense sector. We think of GPS and the internet. But that world has completely changed around that now. Innovation comes from start-ups and academic ecosystems, not from big companies or governments anymore,” said van Weel.   The innovation fund is the second major NATO plan to deal with non-conventional and emerging threats to launch this year. The Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA) launched its first pilot challenge program on June 19.    Will this push to better prepare the West for whatever the next decade looks like succeed? China, after all, is becoming more hostile and there is no certainty as to how the Russia’s war in Ukraine ends, nor if it spills beyond Ukraine’s borders. And if the war does end, is there a risk that allies revert to the complacency of the past?  Giles argues that NATO is dealing with the consequences of decades when its members “had the luxury of pretending that the problem of defense and security had gone away.” Russia’s invasion “ought to have proven beyond any doubt that Europe is under threat and needs to invest in protecting itself, both in terms of conventional and non-conventional security,” he said.   And while politicians are promising renewed spending and attention right now, he fears that convincing the public this is essential, even after Ukraine, is “a leap of imagination that seems beyond the capabilities of most Western politicians.”  Caddick-Adams says that Ukraine provides a window for NATO to prove that the alliance can act effectively without engaging in war itself, thereby making its members more comfortable with spending in the future.   “Ukraine has become a springboard basically for NATO’s experiments in this non-conventional stuff. Without engaging Russia, NATO has enabled Ukraine to try some of the things NATO would like to do but politically cannot do. It answers a lot of questions about warmongering or German uneasiness, but militarily in terms of capabilities,” he said.   It’s easy to forget exactly how recently Macron made his “brain death” comments. The manner in which the alliance was caught cold by Putin’s escalation might lend some credibility to that view.  But the alliance’s unity has been one of the least expected and most welcome aspects of the West’s response to the war in Ukraine. And the relative stability of the politics within the alliance has created windows for NATO to try new things and get the money to do so.   However, officials are also aware that this collegiate approach might not last forever. And it’s not the unknown factor of how long the war persists and countries losing interest that worries some officials the most. It’s the prospect of elections happening across the alliance in which the issue of Ukraine could become a wedge issue – including the small matter of the race for the White House in 2024.   \n",

      "Wagner Group forces took out six Russian helicopters and another aircraft during Yevgeny Prigozhin's short-lived rebellion, Ukrainian officials said Sunday, in a development that could hand Ukraine a defensive edge in the fighting.According to The Kyiv Independent, Yurii Ihnat, a Ukrainian Air Force spokesperson, emphasized the benefit to Ukraine, saying: \"Mi-8 transport helicopters are powerful hardware that really helps the Russian army in its war against Ukraine.\"Reports differ on the exact specifications of the destroyed aircraft. Ihnat has said that Wagner took out two attack helicopters and four transport aircraft, while pro-Kremlin military bloggers were cited by The Kyiv Independent as saying three of them were electronic-warfare helicopters. The open-source weapons tracker site Oryx, whose helicopter tally matches that of the cited military bloggers, said it had documented evidence of the following Russian losses: a Mi-35 attack helicopter, a Ka-52 attack helicopter, three Mi-8 electronic-warfare helicopters, one Mi-8 transport, and an Il-22M airborne command post.It added that Prigozhin had captured a Russian MRAP patrol vehicle and a Tigr-M infantry mobility vehicle. Oryx said that Prigozhin had lost two trucks, two technical vehicles, and an infantry mobility vehicle to the Russian army proper. After an astonishing 36 hours, which saw Prigozhin direct his militia into action on Russian soil and then make a rush toward Moscow, Russian leadership and the paramilitary boss reached a wary agreement in which Prigozhin was exiled to Belarus.Hanna Malyar, Ukraine's deputy defense minister, told The Associated Press: \"The enemy's weakness is always a window of opportunity. It allows us to take the advantage.\"It's too soon to see how the chaos between Wagner and the Russian military establishment will affect things on the ground, she said.On Sunday, as the Wagner debacle unfolded in Russia, Ukrainian soldiers near Bakhmut told Agence France-Presse that it did not appear to have affected the situation there.\"As it attacked yesterday, Russia continued to attack today,\" a soldier identified only as Nazar told the outlet. Nonetheless, the loss of six helicopters in a single weekend is significant.In one year of defending against Russia, Ukraine had shot down about 30 of Russia's helicopters, Forbes reported in February. At that time, Russia had about 300 helicopters — around half of them attack helicopters — based near its western borders, The Kyiv Post reported.As the recent chaos unfolded in Russia, Ukraine said it had managed to push forward in its counteroffensive. As of early Monday local time, Ukraine's military said it had advanced half a mile around the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, The Guardian reported. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Monday that Prigozhin's rebellion was evidence Putin had made a \"big strategic mistake\" in invading Ukraine last year, the outlet added. \n",

      "The Kremlin has forged a deal with Wagner Group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin to defuse the mercenary group's uprising on Saturday.In exchange for Prigozhin's exile to Belarus, the mercenary leader won't be prosecuted, the Associated Press reported, citing a Kremlin spokesperson.The reported agreement comes after a paramilitary rebellion on Saturday in which the Wagner Group marched across Russia before suddenly turning around just 120 miles from Moscow. Prigozhin said he didn't want to shed Russian blood.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced Saturday that Prigozhin — and the troops who follow him — will not face criminal prosecution as part of the deal. He also said those troops who did not join in the uprising would be offered Defense Ministry contracts. Saturday's rebellion marked the strongest threat to President Vladimir Putin's power in over 20 years. Prigozhin had dubbed his procession towards Moscow a \"march for justice,\" and made baseless claims that Russia's defense minister had ordered an air strike on the Wagner Group on Friday and killed large numbers of troops. The Kremlin denied the allegation.Earlier on Saturday, Prigozhin posted a voice note to his Telegram channel, calling his 25,000 troops \"patriots\" and defending their cause. \"We don't want the country to continue to live any longer in corruption, deceit, and bureaucracy,\" Prigozhin said, according to a Reuters translation.Belarus President Aleksandr Lukashenko, a close Putin ally who has also long known Prigozhin, spent all day Saturday negotiating with Prigozhin, according to The New York Times. Prigozhin was once, himself, a close Putin ally, but tensions have grown high since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Prigozhin evenly openly criticized Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a \"racket\" in a public statement last week, the Times reported. Though he didn't directly criticize Putin, he publicly refuted Russia's justification for the invasion. \"The war wasn't needed to return Russian citizens to our bosom, nor to demilitarize or denazify Ukraine,\" Prigozhin said. \"The war was needed so that a bunch of animals could simply exult in glory.\"The Wagner Group's rebellion first began Friday. By the next day, Putin had formally accused Prigozhin of treason and issued a warrant for his arrest.Moscow had been bracing for violence, with residents fleeing, city officials warning people to stay home, and workers destroying highways leading into the city.By Saturday, the Wagner Group had apparently gained control of military headquarters in Rostov-on-Don, a city 660 miles south of Moscow where Russia's operations in Ukraine are managed, according to the Associated Press. On Saturday, the mercenary group was reportedly also in Lipesk province, just 225 miles south of Moscow. \n",

      "We just saw the latest impact from the Supreme Court’s recent surprise ruling on the Voting Rights Act — the surprise being that the court sided with voting rights in that Alabama case. After that June 8 ruling in Allen v. Milligan, the court on Monday dismissed a similar Voting Rights Act appeal from Louisiana — with the upshot being that a fairer congressional map may be used in Louisiana ahead of the 2024 elections. More broadly, the Milligan case puts Democrats in a better position to win the House of Representatives. In Milligan, a bare majority of the Supreme Court upheld a crucial part of the Voting Rights Act, the landmark civil rights law that the court had previously gutted another part of in Shelby County v. Holder. Given the court’s opposition to voting rights over the years, including in Shelby County, a similar ruling was expected in the Alabama case.  But in a 5-4 vote, the court said the Alabama map in question diluted Black voting power. The ruling paved the way for fairer maps not only in Alabama but in other states, such as Louisiana — specifically, it carved a path for adding a second “majority-minority” district, creating the possibility of more equal representation relative to the state’s population.  To be sure, the Supreme Court already did damage on this front, by allowing these apparently illegal maps in the 2022 midterms, in which Republicans barely won the House, before its surprise ruling in Milligan. And further litigation will proceed in the Louisiana case at the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the most right-wing appeals court in the country. So we will see how the 5th Circuit handles the case going forward. But with Milligan as precedent, it will be more difficult for right-wing courts to dismantle voting rights.

      "Ja'han Jones\n",
      "This was bound to happen.  OpenAI, the tech company responsible for developing the artificial intelligence chatbot known as ChatGPT, is being sued over its practice of scraping other people’s information from the internet in order to provide users of the tool with seemingly human responses.  Microsoft, a major investor in OpenAI, is also named as a defendant. OpenAI and Microsoft do not appear to have publicly commented on the lawsuit. The class-action lawsuit strikes at the heart of generative AI tools that appear to create content from “scratch,” like ChatGPT. In reality, such chatbots are built to scour the internet (including social media platforms) to inform their responses.  For those who aren’t techies, think of chatbots like a super-powered internet search. While you historically would type in a term and then receive a list of links, chatbot responses rapidly search the internet for content that’s already been created, as well as other information that may exist on the web, and synthesize the findings into a human-sounding response.  The lawsuit claims OpenAI engages in theft when its technology does this: (Note: OpenAI isn’t the only company creating generative AI tools, though it’s arguably the most popular. Hence the “arms race” line in the quote above.) The lawsuit accuses OpenAI of scraping data belonging to millions of users, including online conversations, location data and other personal information that the company is able to obtain through third-party applications. The suit lists Spotify, Stripe, Slack, Snapchat, Microsoft Teams and the health app MyChart as some of the third parties that allow OpenAI access to user data. OpenAI secretly harvests “massive amounts of personal data from the internet,” the suit claims, “including private information and private conversations, medical data, information about children—essentially every piece of data exchanged on the internet it could take—without notice to the owners or users of such data, much less with anyone’s permission.” The lawsuit doesn’t list the plaintiffs’ names beyond initials — in order to “avoid intrusive scrutiny as well as any potentially dangerous backlash” — but it does offer details about their claims. Some of the plaintiffs say they’re worried that their online content could be used to help replace human workers with robots. For example, the lawsuit says one educator is “concerned that Defendants have taken her skills and expertise, as reflected in her online contributions, and incorporated it into Products that could someday result in professional obsolescence for professors and educators like her.”  The suit also claims that without “this unprecedented theft of private and copyrighted information belonging to real people, communicated to unique communities, for specific purposes, targeting specific audiences, the Products would not be the multi-billion-dollar business they are today.” It’s no overstatement to say this lawsuit could slow — if not completely alter — the fast-moving world of generative AI. Visual artists whose works have been scraped by AI tools have already filed at least one class-action suit of their own, claiming this amounts to copyright infringement. Several musicians have spoken out against the use of generative AI in their industry as well. But professional artists and creators clearly aren’t the only ones with skin in the game here, as the latest lawsuit suggests. Everyone who uses the internet should be invested in making sure our data isn’t being used — to great profit and potential peril — by some of the most powerful tech companies in the world.  \n",

Reviewers are loving this because \"it's effective and easy to use.\" Remove years of stains in just one week!www.amazon.comThe reviewer pictures above show results after just one night!BTW: One pen can be used for up to 35 treatments.Promising review: \"SO happy I decided to try this. It seemed kinda ridiculous honestly, a teeth whitening pen? Ooook. After doing strips and trays for years on and off I figured what’s the worst that can happen? I’m out like thirty bucks if it sucks? Whatever. I gotta say I’m pleasantly surprised. I LOVED the idea that I can just paint it on at night and go to sleep, not waiting a half hour like the strips then peeling them off and brushing. After the first application I was pleasantly surprised in the morning to notice a subtle difference in shade. By application four my teeth were noticeably brighter. Definite downside is the clumping of the product on the bristles. I used an alcohol pad after each use. It seemed to do the trick. 10/10 would buy again. Totally worth it for convenience and obvious results alone.\" —A.S.Get it from Amazon for $19.97.\n",

      "1. A mascara to give you lashes so dramatic, no one will believe you when you tell them you bought it for less than $5 on Amazon. No need to spend hours wrestling with falsies to get the long lashes of your dreams. Reviewers also rave that this lasts all day. Thank goodness! You have better things to do than re-apply throughout the day. Kayla Boyd / BuzzFeedPromising review: \"I’m a teacher and since the pandemic hit, I no longer wear makeup to school. Makeup irritates my skin with my mask so I just haven’t been wearing anything plus it makes morning time hella easy. #bareface I only put on the mascara, literally no other makeup on my face. Just my lashes were done with this $5 magic. I kid you not — my lashes were literally ALL I heard about that day. Upon walking into the building, a teacher friend from all the way at the other end of the hall and was like 'oh she got makeup on today!!!!' Each kid that came up to me commented on the lashes. And the best story of all: A teammate of mine was out and the sub was having trouble with the announcements and so I went in to help her. Her homeroom just went bananas about my lashes and then they started clapping and I got a standing ovation. A literal standing ovation. Best $5 I’ve ever spent LOL!\" —KatieGet it from Amazon for $4.99.\n",

They come in pre-measured drop-in packets and are recommended to use about once a week!Promising review: \"It seems counterintuitive to put a little packet down your garbage disposal to clean it, but this does actually seem to work, at least for getting out weird smells that baking soda and vinegar don't really touch. I scrub the sink down first, especially around the garbage disposal area, rinse it down, and then just follow the directions on the package. I have used it with single, large-size sinks and with double sinks — only difference is that the double sink will have blue cleaning foam rise up the drain, which you rinse away when the disposal sounds clear again. I have tried the foaming cleaner in a can, but unfortunately it stopped coming out of the can about 10% of the way through.

Dishwasher cleaning tablets so the machine you rely on to clean the things you use to eat isn't gunking them up even more.Amazon, www.amazon.comThese tablets remove odor-causing residue and help get rid of lime and mineral build-up that naturally occurs inside dishwashers. The tablet is designed to last throughout the entire wash cycle, and is recommended for use about once a month. These are safe to use in stainless-steel tub and plastic tub dishwashers.Promising review: \"After using this product, I am happy to report that my $5 investment saved me over $500. I was ready to replace my dishwasher due to super cloudy glasses, residue, and just not getting clean. Then, I became aware that the water softener no longer was doing its job, so I had the rental company replace it. Dishwasher performance improved somewhat. I decided to do two more loads before deciding to purchase a new one. Then I saw a product test review for Affresh in a magazine. I was ordering some stuff from Amazon anyway, so I added that to my order. When it came, I tossed one of the tablets into the bottom of the full machine, and ran the regular cycle. I did not expect the results I got! My glassware that I thought was permanently etched and ruined came out like new. Same with cutlery. The difference is unbelievable. I will use this faithfully on a monthly basis, as recommended. I can even put it on my subscribe and save order, so I will get a new pack every six months.

It arrived on Monday and on Tuesday morning I woke up with a bug bite on my arm. I used this little tool (3x per the instructions) and documented with photos.

Plus, it's dishwasher-safe and BPA-free. Need more convincing on this amazing coffeemaker? Check out our Takeya cold brew coffee maker review.I had featured this cold brew maker in articles several times before deciding my iced coffee-obsessed self needed to get one. Brewing hot coffee and pouring over ice just doesn't taste good and until they figure out how to grow money on trees, I will not be paying $5 every single day for Starbucks or Dunkin'.I will admit I was hesitant at first. I'm not sure why considering this thing does have excellent reviews, but I didn't want to get my hopes up. You guys...my life is forever changed. I've never made a batch of cold brew in this pitcher that I DIDN'T enjoy. Not only does it make a deliciously rich iced coffee, but you can truly taste the flavor notes in whichever coffee you choose to use in this. It's so easy to make — all you need is ground coffee and water. Knowing that I have fresh cold brew waiting for me in my fridge at all times is the best — I really can't recommend this enough.Get it from Amazon for $27.99+ (available in two sizes).\n",

The shoes that took me a minute of struggling to get into fit *perfectly* now!! The process was as simple as could be, too. I just sprayed my shoes (inside and out, heel to toe) like there was no tomorrow, I put on some semi-thick socks (just to ensure I had ample room later), and wore the shoes around my house for about 30–40 minutes. As I was walking around, I could literally feel them begin to loosen up. After about 30 minutes, I took my shoes and thick socks off, and the shoes just ~slide~ on. Easy Peasy. Now I have a new favorite pair of shoes and zero dollars have been wasted. I tried these with a pair of chunky leather loafers, but I can only imagine what they'll do for my pair of Dr. Martens — the boots known to take a while to break into. This stuff is a must!\" Get it from Amazon for $9.99. \n",

      "https://www.wired.com/story/tyranny-ultra-processed-food-van-tulleken/\n",
      "Chris van Tulleken\n",
      "This type of food is usually wrapped in plastic and has additives that you won’t find in a typical kitchen. In the US and the UK, we get on average 60 percent of our calories from UPF products like pizza, bread, breakfast cereals, biscuits, and nutritional drinks. They’re often sold as healthy options, but it’s just a way of turning our ill health into money. UPF is a byproduct of a complicated financial system that involves repurposing waste from animal food into human food.\n",
      "To solve this problem, the first thing we need to do is include in the official UK guidance about nutrition the information that ultra-processed foods are associated with weight gain and diet-related diseases, and that the recommendation for people is to avoid these foods. Many countries like Brazil and France already do this.\n",
      "Limiting the marketing of ultra-processed foods is essential. We need to learn the lessons from regulating the tobacco industry and stop predatory companies selling this food to people.\n",
      "We also need to change the ultra-processed institutional food that we serve in hospitals, schools, and prisons. There is very good evidence that when feeding patients and staff in hospitals, real food is hugely beneficial.\n",
      "There are also misconceptions we need to address. For instance, people who live with diet-related diseases, especially obesity, usually have a strong feeling of guilt, thinking they are the problem due to their own lack of willpower. Researchers now know this isn’t true. This food has been engineered to be addictive. We need to shift the blame away from the population.\n",
      "Normally, we would blame the food companies and demand change from them. But when you speak to people in any of those companies it’s very clear that they are unable to change. Danone is the best example of this. Its previous CEO, Emmanuel Faber, tried to turn the company into a social enterprise by stopping the sale of ultra-processed food and increasing the environmental portfolio. The share price tanked, activist investors threw him out, and Danone had no option but to go back to its previous business model. All the big transnational food corporations are answerable to their owners. If we don’t understand this financial loop, we will keep shouting at companies that cannot change their business model. What we have to understand is that the responsibility lies with governments. They need a mandate from their population to change the regulations.\n",
      "Another group of people whom we don’t criticize enough are the doctors, who have a very long history of partnering with transnational food corporations and supplement providers to mislead people. Most nutrition research is funded by the food industry and that’s clearly wrong.\n",
      "Anyone who’s struggling with this as an individual should take their guilt and shame and transfer it outwardly to the corporations that are feeding us these addictive substances, to the governments doing nothing about it, and to the physicians and the social media personalities who keep telling us that this stuff is healthy. We need to end the conflict of interest between the industry and politicians, doctors and scientists. Only then can we really tackle the problem.\n",

      "https://www.wired.com/story/states-with-abortion-bans-are-losing-a-generation-of-ob-gyns/\n",
      "Maryn McKenna\n",
      "Fishbach was in Michigan, where an abortion ban enacted in 1931 instantly came into effect. That law made administering an abortion a felony punishable by four years in prison, with no exceptions for rape or incest. It was a chilling moment: Her residency is in obstetrics and gynecology, and she viewed mastering abortion procedures as essential to her training.\n",
      "“I suspected during my application cycle that this could happen, and to receive confirmation of it was devastating,” she recalls. “But I had strategically applied where I thought that, even if I didn't receive the full spectrum, I would at least have the support and the resources to get myself to an institution that would train me.”\n",
      "Her mind whirled through the possibilities. Would her program help its residents go to an access-protecting state? Could she broker an agreement to go somewhere on her own, arranging weeks of extra housing and obtaining a local medical license and insurance? Would she still earn her salary if she left her program—and how would she fund her life if she did not?\n",
      "In the end, she didn’t need to leave. That November, Michigan voters approved an amendment to the state constitution that made the 1931 law unenforceable, and this April, Governor Gretchen Whitmer repealed the ban. Fishbach didn’t have to abandon the state to learn the full range of ob-gyn care. In fact, her program at the University of Michigan, where she’s now a second-year resident, pivoted to making room for red-state trainees.\n",
      "But the dizzying reassessment she underwent a year ago provides a glimpse of the challenges that face thousands of new and potential doctors. Almost 45 percent of the 286 accredited ob-gyn programs in the US now operate under revived or new abortion bans, meaning that more than 2,000 residents per year—trainee doctors who have committed to the specialty—may not receive the required training to be licensed. Among students and residents, simmering anger over bans is growing. Long-time faculty fear the result will be a permanent reshaping of American medicine, driving new doctors from red states to escape limitations and legal threats, or to protect their own reproductive options. That would reduce the number of physicians available, not just to provide abortions, but to conduct genetic screenings, care for miscarriages, deliver babies, and handle unpredictable pregnancy risks.\n",
      "“I worry that we’re going to see an increase in maternal morbidity, differentially, depending on where you live,” says Kate Shaw, a physician and associate chair of ob-gyn education at Stanford Medicine. “And that’s just going to further enhance disparities that already exist.”\n",
      "Those effects are not yet visible. The pipeline that ushers medical graduates through physician training is about a decade long: four years of school plus three to seven years of residency, sometimes with a two-year, sub-specialty fellowship afterward. Thus actions taken in response to the Dobbs decision—people eschewing red-state schools or choosing to settle in blue states long-term—might take a while to be noticeable.\n",
      "But in this year, some data has emerged that suggests trends to come. In February, a group of students, residents and faculty surveyed 2,063 licensed and trainee physicians and found that 82 percent want to work or train in states that retain abortion access—and 76 percent would refuse to apply in states that restrict it. (The respondents worked in a mix of specialties; for those whose work would include performing abortions, the proportion intending to work where it remains legal soared above 99 percent.)\n",
      "Then in April, a study from the Association of American Medical Colleges drawing on the first round of applications to residency programs after Dobbs found that ob-gyn applications in states with abortion restrictions sank by 10 percent compared to the previous year. Applications to all ob-gyn programs dropped by 5 percent. (Nationwide, all applications to residency went down 2 percent from 2021 to 2022.)\n",
      "Last month, two preliminary pieces of research presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists uncovered more perturbations. In Texas—where the restrictive law SB8 went into effect in September 2021, nine months before Dobbs—a multi-year upward trend in applications to ob-gyn residency slowed after the law passed. And in an unrelated national survey, 77 percent of 494 third- and fourth-year medical students said that abortion restrictions would affect where they applied to residency, while 58 percent said they were unlikely to apply to states with a ban.\n",
      "That last survey was conducted by Ariana Traub and Kellen “Nell” Mermin-Bunnell, two third-year medical students at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta—which lies within a state with a “fetal heartbeat” law that predates Dobbs and that criminalizes providing an abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. The law means that students in clinical rotations are unlikely to witness abortions and would not be allowed to discuss the procedure with patients. It also means that, if either of them were to become pregnant while at med school, they would not have that option themselves.\n",
      "Before they published the survey, the two friends conducted an analysis of how bans would affect medical school curricula, using data collected in the summer of 2022. They predicted that only 29 percent of the more than 129,000 medical students in the US would not be affected by state bans. The survey gave them a chance to sample med students’ feelings about those developments, with the help of faculty members. They also founded a nonprofit, Georgia Healthcare Professionals for Reproductive Justice. “We're in a unique position, as individuals in the health care field but not necessarily medical professionals yet,” Traub says. “We have some freedom. So we felt like we had to use that power to try to make change.”\n",
      "The conflict between what medicine demands and state laws prevent leaves new and would-be doctors in restrictive states struggling with their inability to follow medical evidence and their own best intentions. “I’m starting to take care of patients for the first time in my life,” says Mermin-Bunnell, Traub’s survey partner. “Seeing a human being in front of you, who needs your help, and not being able to help them or even talk to them about what their options might be—it feels morally wrong.”\n",
      "That frustration is equally evident among trainees in specialties who might treat a pregnant person, prescribe treatments that could imperil a pregnancy, or care for a pregnancy gone wrong. Those include family and adolescent medicine, anesthesiology, radiology, rheumatology, even dermatology and mental health.\n",
      "“I’m particularly interested in oncology, and I’ve come to realize that you can’t have the full standard of gynecologic oncology care without being able to have access to abortion care,” says Morgan Levy, a fourth-year medical student in Florida who plans to apply to ob-gyn residency. Florida currently bans abortion after 15 weeks; a further ban, down to six weeks, passed in April but has been held up by legal challenges. In three years of med school so far, Levy received one lecture on abortion—in the context of miscarriage—and no clinical exposure to the procedure. “It is a priority for me to make sure that I get trained,” she says.\n",
      "But landing in a training program that encourages abortion practice is more difficult than it looks. Residency application is an algorithm-driven process in which graduates list their preferred programs, and faculty rank the trainees they want to teach. For years, there have been more applicants than there are spaces—and this year, as in the past, ob-gyn programs filled almost all their slots. What that means, according to faculty members, is that some applicants will end up where they do not want to be.\n",
      "“Students and trainees do exert their preferences, but they also need to get a training spot,” says Vineet Arora, the dean for medical education at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine and lead author on the survey published in February. “Would they forgo a training spot because of Dobbs? That's a tall order, especially in a competitive field. But would they be happy about it? And would they want to stay there long term?”\n",
      "That is not a hypothetical question. According to the medical-colleges association, more than half of residents stay to practice in the states where they trained. But it’s reasonable to ask whether they would feel that loyalty if they were deprived of training or forced to relocate. “If even a portion of the 80 percent of people who prefer to practice and train in states that don't have abortion bans follow through on those preferences, those states that are putting in abortion bans—which often have workforce shortages already—will be in a worse situation,” Arora says.\n",
      "An ACOG analysis estimated in 2017 that half of US counties, which are home to 10 million women, have no practicing ob-gyn. When the health care tech firm Doximity examined ob-gyn workloads in 2019, seven of the 10 cities it identified as having the highest workloads lie in what are now very restrictive states. Those shortages are likely to worsen if new doctors relocate to states where they feel safe. The legal and consulting firm Manatt Health predicted in a white paper last fall: “The impact on access to all OB/GYN care in certain geographies could be catastrophic.”\n",
      "Steinauer directs the Kenneth J. Ryan Residency Training Program, a 24-year-old effort to install and reinforce clinical abortion training. Even before Dobbs, that was hard to come by: In 2018, Steinauer and colleagues estimated that only two-thirds of ob-gyn residency programs made it routine, despite accreditation requirements—and that anywhere from 29 to 78 percent of residents couldn’t competently perform different types of abortion when they left training. In 2020, researchers from UCSF and UC Berkeley documented that 57 percent of these programs face limitations set by individual hospitals more extreme than those set by states.\n",
      "Before Dobbs, the Ryan program brokered individual relocations that let trainees temporarily transfer to other institutions. Now it is working to set up program-to-program agreements instead, because the logistics required to visit for a rotation—the kind of arrangements Fishbach dizzily imagined a year ago—are more complex than most people can manage on their own. And not only on the visiting trainee: Programs already perform delicate calculations of how many trainees they can take given the number of patients coming to their institutions and the number of faculty mentors.\n",
      "Only a few places have managed to institutionalize “away rotations,” in which they align accreditation milestones, training time, and financing with other institutions. Oregon Health & Science University’s School of Medicine is about to open a formal program that will accept 10 to 12 residents from restrictive states for a month each over a year. Oregon imposes no restrictions on abortion, and both the med school’s existing residents and the university’s philanthropic foundation supported the move.\n",
      "“I'm very concerned about having a future generation that knows how to provide safe abortion care—because abortion will never go away; becoming illegal only makes it less safe,” says Alyssa Colwill, who oversees the new program and is an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology. “There are going to be patients that are going to use unsafe methods because there's no other alternative. And providers are going to be placed in scenarios that are heartbreaking, and are devastating to watch.”\n",
      "This isn’t imaginary: Already, research has shown that physicians practicing in red states are less likely to offer appropriate and legal procedures to treat miscarriages. Receiving abortion training, in other words, also improves medical care for pregnancy loss.\n",
      "“Ultimately, I do not think there is capacity to train every resident who wants training,” says Charisse Loder, a clinical assistant professor of ob-gyn at the University of Michigan Medical School, who directs the program where Fishbach is training. “So we will have ob-gyn residents who are not trained in this care. And I think that is not only unfortunate, but puts patients in a position of being cared for by residents who don't have comprehensive training.”\n",
      "Doing only short rotations also returns residents to places where their own reproductive health could be put at risk. Future physicians are likely to be older than in previous generations, having been encouraged to get life experience and sample other careers before entering med school. Research on which Levy and Arora collaborated in 2022 shows that more than 11 percent of new physicians had abortions during their training. Because of the length of training, they also may be more likely to use IVF when they are ready to start families—and some reproductive technologies may be criminalized under current abortion bans.\n",
      "As a fourth and final-year psychiatry resident, Simone Bernstein had thought about abortion restrictions through the lens of her patients’ mental health, as she talked to them about fertility treatment and pregnancy loss. As cofounder of the online platform Inside the Match, she had listened to residents’ reactions to Dobbs (and collaborated on research with Levy and Arora). She had not expected the decision to affect her personally—but she is in Missouri, a state where there is an almost complete ban on abortion. And this spring, she experienced a miscarriage at 13 weeks of pregnancy.\n",
      "“I was worried whether or not I could even go to the hospital, if my baby still had a heartbeat, which was a conversation that I had to have with my ob-gyn on the phone,” she says. “It didn’t come to that; I caught the baby in my hands at home, hemorrhaging blood everywhere, and the baby had already passed away. But until that moment, I didn't recognize the effects that [abortion restrictions] could have on me.”\n",
      "This is the reality now: There exist very few places in the US where abortion is uncomplicated. Faculty and their trainees do not expect that to change, except for the worse. Staying in the field, and making sure the next generation is prepared, requires commitment that they will have to sustain for years.\n",
      "“Part of the reason why I sought advanced training in abortion and contraception is because I think there will be a national ban,” says Abigail Liberty, an ob-gyn and fellow in her sixth postgraduate year at OHSU. “I think it will happen in our lifetime. And I see my role as getting as much expertise and training as I can now and providing care while I can. And then coming out of retirement, when abortion will be legal again, and training the next generation of physicians.” \n",

      "Patrick Smith\n",
      "Is late truly better than never?  When King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands commemorates the 160th anniversary of the country’s abolition of slavery on Saturday (July 1), he is widely expected to apologize for the Dutch imperial slave trade. The weight of history is bearing down on the king. For decades campaigners in former Dutch colonies in the Caribbean have called on the Netherlands to apologize and pay reparations for the brutal and systematic trade in human lives in the 17th and 18th centuries.  The Netherlands’ reckoning with its past comes as some in Europe grapple with the realities of their brutal colonial and slave-holding history. An apology, which is widely expected, would pile pressure on the royal families of Britain, Belgium and other former slave-trading European nations to do the same. The Dutch royal palace said it does not comment on the king’s upcoming speeches. Still, anything short of an apology would cause uproar among activists. In December Prime Minister Mark Rutte apologized on behalf of the Dutch government to the descendants of enslaved people. And on June 15, the sheer extent of Dutch colonial enslavement was laid bare in a new government-funded academic study called State and Slavery that forensically tells the story of how the small North Sea nation became a world-leading economy in large part through its exploitation of forced labor. The Netherlands’ vast, lucrative network of human trafficking saw hundreds of thousands of people stolen from Africa and sold in the Caribbean and East Asia — something that until now has not been widely known by the country’s citizens, according to the study. It also doesn’t fit the popular image of Holland — as many Netherlanders still call it — as a multicultural and tolerant democracy with a modern bicycle-riding royal family. The study also describes how the king’s predecessors made the equivalent of almost $600 million from the slave trade, having invested nothing At the trade’s height in the 17th and 18th centuries, more than 1,000 enslaved people were taken to Suriname every year to work on sugar plantations, according to State and Slavery.  More than 90% of the population in what was then a South American colony were enslaved and conditions were so harsh that the number of births never outpaced the number of deaths, the study showed. The study’s findings have surprised many in the Netherlands, including those who read advance copies, said one of its editors, Esther Captain, an expert at the Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies, in the Dutch city of Leiden. “I was shocked because you would assume that [it is] basic in general knowledge, but it’s not,” she told NBC News by telephone. “I think it is to do with the fact that this is confronting our self-image. We used to sell ourselves as tolerant, open-minded and democratic. And I think this is challenging our very self image, and that hurts.” The church, the navy and the royal family each played a part in the human trafficking of an estimated 600,000 people, mainly to Suriname and the Antilles islands in the Caribbean. Successive generations were born into this often deadly cycle of servitude.  Plantation owners busied themselves with reading, writing, sports and other leisure pursuits as workers toiled in the hot sun while facing physical and sexual abuse. The Dutch began trading slaves in the 1500s and became a major player in the 1600s. Slavery only ended in the Dutch Caribbean islands and Suriname in 1863 — although some slaves were not freed for another 10 years. The Netherlands relented in the face of international pressure, not least from Britain, which ended its part in the Atlantic slave trade in 1808. (The United States abolished slavery in 1865.) Slavery was also enforced in the Dutch East Indies — a major colony that included modern-day Indonesia — until the 19th century. In response to questions from NBC News, Pauline van Voorst, a spokesperson for the Dutch government, echoed Rutte's apology in admitting the country had too late in acting on the legacy of slavery.  \"For centuries, under Dutch state authority, human dignity was violated in the most horrific way possible. And successive Dutch governments after 1863 failed to adequately see and acknowledge that our slavery past continued to have negative effects and still does,\" she said. On the question of reparations, she said that various assistance packages were already in place to help former colonies, designed to improve local economies.  The State and Slavery project was funded by a 200 million euro (about $218 million) commission to explore and expose the country’s colonial past, announced by Rutte in December. Some countries have made similar moves and even paid reparations. King Charles III said in April that Buckingham Palace will cooperate with research into the British royalty’s links to slavery, and Belgium set up a commission to study its links in 2020. Belgian lawmakers spent hours last year debating whether and how to make an apology but came to no agreement, and the British project is not due to complete until 2026.  Belgium’s King Philippe expressed his “deepest regrets” last June while on a trip to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where from 1885 to 1908 the government, under the supervision of King Leopold II, extracted a fortune in natural resources while enslaving, maiming, torturing and killing many thousands of people. Britain has “fallen behind the international conversation” in owning up to its colonial past, said Sathnam Sanghera, a journalist and author of “Empireland,” a bestselling 2021 book about the legacy of British colonialism.  “That the Dutch have commissioned historians and given an apology just highlights how little we’ve done,” he said. King Charles’ coronation, which included items glittering with precious gems taken from British colonies, underlined Britain’s imperial past. “It kept coming up during the coronation, every other Commonwealth was raising it, whether it was loot, slavery or the legacy of it,” Sanghera said. “This is going to be the conversation for the next 20 years.” Britain was an early and enthusiastic participant in the transatlantic slave trade in the 16th and 17th centuries, which helped build an empire that reigned over some 400 million inhabitants at its height in the early 20th century. In 2021, Germany called its actions in Namibia “genocide” and pledged 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in reparations, and the same year French President Emmanuel Macron apologized to Algerians who fought alongside French forces but were later killed as traitors. “You have Germany doing that, you have the Netherlands doing that. And it pressures Belgium, who have kind of stuck their heels in the sand,” said Jeremiah Garsha, an expert in colonial history at University College Dublin. The State and Slavery project made headlines last week for revealing how much money Dutch kings made from slavery. But Garsha added that reducing an entire country’s colonial misdeeds to a number is in itself a continuation of the colonial attitude: that people can be financial assets. “Those are numbers that continue to kind of enslave people in our mindset — they’re chattel, they’re property. No. These are experiences, these are human experiences,” he said. “That’s what I want to recover.” \n",

      "A train carrying hazardous materials derailed and a bridge collapsed into a southern Montana river Saturday, sending rail cars into the water and prompting concerns about contamination.  Some of those fears may have been allayed by evening as rail officials said two cars known to be carrying sodium hydro sulfate, which can burn, irritate and cause shortness of breath, had not entered the Yellowstone River below the failed bridge.  No hazardous materials were released from those particular rail cars, said Andy Garland, a spokesperson for Montana Rail Link.  But an unspecified number of other cars containing molten sulfur and asphalt had been “compromised,” he said in a statement. Officials will continue to monitor the derailment site, he said. No injuries were reported, officials said.  As many as eight cars derailed, Columbus, Montana, Fire Chief Rich Cowger told NBC affiliate KULR of Billings. Billings said in a statement that it would shut down city water system intakes fed by the Yellowstone River for the time any pollutant would need to pass and end up downstream. Billings, a city of nearly 110,000 people, has a clean supply of drinking water in its system, including storage tanks that are full, it said. Laurel, Montana, suspended its intake from the river and temporarily shut down its water treatment plant Saturday morning, but a few hours later it reconnected its supply and restarted treatment, officials said in a statement. Laurel officials visited the derailment site and investigated the water system, the statement said. Water treatment plants in Yellowstone County were working as normal as officials monitored the river for any signs of contaminants, county officials said in a statement. “At this time there have been no reported negative impacts to Yellowstone County,” its government said in a statement. The train derailed and the bridge collapsed about 6 a.m. near the community of Reed Point, said officials in Stillwater County, which abuts Yellowstone County. The bridge over the Yellowstone River was described as a rail bridge in the statement Saturday. The National Transportation Safety Board said in a statement Saturday evening that it is sending an investigative team to the derailment site. The Federal Railroad Administration is leading the inquiry, the NTSB said. It was not immediately clear whether the collapse or the derailment happened first or what caused either.  Asphalt contains carcinogens, and it has been linked to some forms of cancer. Molten sulfur can cause serious thermal burns upon contact and will form toxic and flammable gases when it reacts to hydrocarbon, a compound at the heart of fossil fuels. \n",

Note: Enabling this option may have privacy implications, as Siri can be accessed even when your device is locked.&nbsp; You can also customize Siri's voice and language settings on this screen by selecting Siri Voice and Language options.&nbsp; Once you have enabled Siri, you can activate it by either pressing and holding the Home button (on iPhone models with a Home button) or by saying \"Hey Siri\" followed by your command (if the \"Listen for 'Hey Siri'\" option is enabled). Siri should now be active and ready to assist you on your iPhone. Now that you have Siri set up. let's dive into 10 hidden Siri features that can be super helpful.&nbsp; Top 10 hidden Siri features  1. Customized pronunciation   If you use Siri to call contacts, you may have experienced the voice mispronouncing a name. You can actually teach Siri how to say your loved ones' names properly thanks to a type of field that can be added to the person's contact on your iPhone.&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the next time Siri mispronounces a name, to fix this you can say, \"Hey Siri, that's not how you pronounce [name]\".&nbsp; Siri will then prompt you to do the following (or can proceed to do this now if you’d like)&nbsp; Launch the Contacts app on your ‌iPhone‌&nbsp; Select a person in your contacts&nbsp; Tap Edit in the top right corner&nbsp; Under the \"Notes\" section, tap add field&nbsp; Select Pronunciation first name or Pronunciation second name, depending on which name ‌Siri‌ is having trouble with&nbsp; Next, tap the pronunciation field and spell out the name phonetically (how it sounds)&nbsp; Tap Done in the top-right corner when you're finished.&nbsp; The next time ‌Siri‌ says the name, it will follow your phonetic spelling.&nbsp; 2. Remember where you parked your car   Not only can you use Siri to help you remember where you parked your car, the assistant can also help you find your car if needed. iPhones are great at identifying when you've parked and left the location, yet if you ever want to be certain about where your car is, you can drop a pin on your Maps app by using Siri.&nbsp; Just say, \"Hey Siri, remember where I parked my car\" before you leave the spot. Then you can retrieve the parking lot location when you want to find your parked car.&nbsp; Just ask Siri by saying, \"Hey Siri, where did I park my car?\" Siri will then provide you with the information it stored about your parking location, such as the address or a map with directions to your car.&nbsp; 3. Use Siri to find an AirTag   If you use Apple AirTags, you know how helpful they are for keeping track of keys, your pets, or any other device you attach them to. You may not have realized this, but you can use Siri to find your AirTags if they're within Bluetooth range.&nbsp; Just say, \"Hey Siri, find my AirTag.\" Then, depending on the location, Siri may provide guidance on which direction it is in relation to where you are, or it may tell you if your AirTag is nearby.&nbsp; MORE: AIRTAG TRACKER DETECTOR WARNS OF STALKERS IN SECONDS&nbsp; 4. Set up reminders for specific apps   Siri can set reminders for apps on your device, and you can tell Siri exactly when or where you want to be reminded.&nbsp; For instance, if your iPhone has your home location set up, you can say, \"Hey Siri, remind me to check my email when I get home,\" and Siri will create a reminder to open the Mail app when you arrive at that address. You can also say, \"Hey Siri, remind me to open [app name],\" and specify a time for that reminder to pop up on your iPhone.&nbsp; In order for this feature to work, you will need to enable location services from the reminders app. Here's how:&nbsp; Open the Settings app on your iPhone&nbsp; Scroll down and tap on Privacy &amp; Security&nbsp; In the Privacy settings, select Location Services&nbsp; From here, you have a couple of options:&nbsp; If location services are turned off entirely, you'll need to toggle the switch ON at the top to enable them. You may be prompted to enter your device passcode or use Touch ID/Face ID to make changes.&nbsp; If location services are already enabled, scroll down to find the Reminders app in the list and tap on it.&nbsp; Now, you should see three options: Never, While Using the App, and Always. Choose either While Using the App or Always, depending on your preference and the level of access you want to grant to the Reminders app.&nbsp; Keep in mind that enabling location services may improve the functionality of certain features, but it also consumes more battery power. Make sure to consider your preferences and privacy concerns when choosing the level of access to grant to any app.&nbsp; 5. Keep up with sports   If you're a sports fan, you may know that Siri can provide sports scores. However, did you know you can also ask Siri about upcoming games, team schedules, and player information? For example, you can ask, \"Hey Siri, when is the next Yankees game?\" or \"Hey Siri, what's the Golden State Warriors' schedule this week?\" &nbsp; 6. Identify a song playing   If you're out in a coffee shop or in a store and you hear a song playing and want to know the title or artist, you can say, \"Hey Siri, what song is playing?\". Siri will listen to the audio and try to identify the song using Shazam integration. It will provide you with the song details and a link to listen to or purchase it. Personally, I screenshot it, and then I can go back to save it on my streaming app later. &nbsp; MORE: 5 BEST PORTABLE PHONE CHARGERS OF 2023&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Translate languages   You can ask Siri to translate phrases or sentences into different languages. For example, you can say, \"Hey Siri, translate 'Hello, how are you?' to French.\" Siri will provide you with the translated version right there on your iPhone. Even if you have a translator app, this could be a super quick way to communicate or understand someone speaking another language as you. &nbsp; FOR MORE OF MY TECH HACKS, SUBSCRIBE TO MY FREE CYBERGUY REPORT NEWSLETTER BY HEADING TO CYBERGUY.COM/NEWSLETTER &nbsp; 8. Teach Siri who your contacts are  Everyone has a personal preference for how they keep contact names on their phone. Sometimes you may have someone saved as their first name, yet you more often call them by a nickname or by using a description when talking to Siri.&nbsp; Help Siri understand who the contact names in your phone are by saying something like, \"Hey Siri, Joe is my son.\"&nbsp; Then, if you say, \"Hey Siri, call my son,\" your phone will know who you're referring to. You can also use this trick for your husband or wife, mom or dad, or just about any label you can think of.&nbsp; HOW TO MAKE SIRI LISTEN TO YOU LONGER ON IPHONE AND IPAD 9. Change basic settings   Sometimes it's annoying to swipe to the control center or figure out where in your settings certain things are - so use Siri to do it all more quickly. For example, you can tell Siri to adjust these settings:&nbsp; \"Hey Siri, adjust the volume of my phone\"&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Hey Siri, turn on (or off) Airplane mode\"&nbsp; \"Hey Siri, turn on (or off) Low Power Mode\"&nbsp; \"Hey Siri, turn on (or off) Bluetooth\"&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also ask Siri to open settings for specific apps like Chrome or your camera.&nbsp; \"Hey Siri, open Chrome\"&nbsp; \"Hey Siri, open my camera\"&nbsp; 10. Turn off or restart your phone   Shutting down your phone or restarting it can fix a number of common glitches that happen on all technology. It's also somewhat tedious to hold down the side buttons or a combination of a side and home button, depending on your phone model. Save time by having Siri do it for you.&nbsp; Just say, \"Hey Siri, restart my iPhone.\"&nbsp; You can also shut down your phone using Siri by saying, \"Hey Siri, shut down my phone,\" although you'll need to remember to turn it on manually using the buttons on the phone.&nbsp; Kurt's key takeaways  Siri is handy for a number of reasons, including the voice-activated convenience. For those who have reduced hand dexterity or limitations in physical movement, it's great to just be able to talk to your phone and not have to fuss around with settings or use all the different buttons our iPhones come with. That makes these features particularly valuable for making iPhones all-around more inclusive.

      "Russian President Vladimir Putin is facing the biggest threat to his authority in decades. It comes after Yevgeny Prigozhin, who leads a private paramilitary group called Wagner, started a violent but brief uprising against Russia that may have long-lasting effects which could bring instability to Putin. If Putin is perceived as weakened by this assault on his leadership, then he is likely to exert aggressive strength in a show of power. HOW TO MASTER APPLE IPHONE'S MEASURE APP FOR PRECISE MEASUREMENTS How Putin can show his strength with weaponized tech CLICK TO GET KURT’S FREE CYBERGUY NEWSLETTER WITH SECURITY ALERTS, QUICK TIPS, TECH REVIEWS AND EASY HOW-TO’S TO MAKE YOU SMARTER What few know is that Vladimir Putin has been building a sophisticated facial recognition surveillance system since 2017 that is likely to be put into overdrive against any citizens willing to take on the views of the Russian leadership and military. MORE: POLICE ARE USING INVASIVE FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE TO PUT EVERY AMERICAN IN A PERPETUAL LINEUP&nbsp;  Russian surveillance technology is powered in part by Silicon Valley big tech companies in the U.S. Facial recognition systems used by the Russian government are widely available around the world.&nbsp; Russia has worked with tech companies within its own walls, and Belarus building sophisticated algorithms that make it highly accurate and efficient at population surveillance.&nbsp; Ironically, while it seems to serve the purpose of limiting freedom, the technology works thanks to chips made by U.S. companies Intel and Nvidia. There is no evidence that either US company broke any export restrictions, and neither knows nor tracks how their technologies are being used.&nbsp; Prior to any ban, it would have been easy for the Russian government to source all the needed components to build a powerful spy mechanism to track its population. FOR MORE OF MY SECURITY ALERTS, SUBSCRIBE TO MY FREE CYBERGUY REPORT NEWSLETTER BY HEADING TO CYBERGUY.COM/NEWSLETTER&nbsp;  How Russian police use facial recognition surveillance to oppress its citizens Police have been known to stop and detain members of the public they suspect could challenge the authority of the Kremlin.&nbsp; Hold up a poster that says \"Freedom for Russia\" and \"No to War,\" and your identity can be captured and held against you. OVD-Info, a human rights organization, tracks the Russian government's repression of its citizens and has identified 19,700 detained Russian people dating back from May 2023. DON’T FALL FOR THIS SNEAKY NAMELESS NUMBER TEXT SCAM Russia's spying on its people hinges on this one public necessity It starts with the metro subway system throughout Russia.&nbsp; Passengers are required to scan their faces in order to gain access to a ride.&nbsp; Russia has deployed \"Face Pay\" in at least 240 metro stations. The government claims it is the world's largest implementation of facial recognition.&nbsp; Instead of a smartphone or ticket, the metro deploys facial recognition matching the Russian rider with the account, location, date, and time they access a station. Russian police track public protests by using facial recognition to capture the identities of protestors sweeping up as many dissenters as the surveillance system can digest. The system has been used to prevent unauthorized gatherings by blocking access to certain metro stations or sending alerts to the police. MORE: HOW TO STOP FACIAL RECOGNITION CAMERAS FROM MONITORING YOUR EVERY MOVE  When Russian police sweep in to detain its citizens Some hours, days, or weeks later, police located in the metro station confront Russians as they arrive to scan their face to gain access to a train.&nbsp; People have reported being detained anywhere from minutes to 19 hours.&nbsp; While some alleged protestors detained led to arrest and being charged, many report strong-arming tactics being deployed by police to dissuade further protesting or showing public opposition to the government's point of view.&nbsp; It is a crime to be involved in \"public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the armed forces of the Russian Federation\" or to spread false information about the military, which can result in prison time from 3 to 15 years. HOW TO KEEP YOUR PHONE BATTERY CHARGED LONGER Kurt's key takeaway If you have ever wondered why Americans should be wary of similar facial recognition surveillance systems becoming a standard on U.S. soil, you need to look no further than this example of a complete loss of freedom resulting from big brother technology. The potential for abuse and erosion of individual privacy rights is a grave concern that cannot be ignored, especially when considering the potential widespread use of facial recognition surveillance systems in this country.

      "A chiseled block of sandstone in the U.S. Capitol’s visitor center serves as a reminder that the home of the nation’s Congress was built in part by enslaved Black people. A bronze plaque says the stone, originally part of the building’s exterior, “commemorates their important role in building the Capitol.”\n",
      "Many lawmakers need look no further than their own family histories to find a much more personal connection to slavery in America, a brutal system of oppression that resulted in the deadliest conflict in U.S. history.\n",
      "In researching the genealogies of America’s political elite, a Reuters examination found that a fifth of the nation’s congressmen, living presidents, Supreme Court justices and governors are direct descendants of ancestors who enslaved Black people.\n",
      "Among 536 members of the last sitting Congress, Reuters determined at least 100 descend from slaveholders. Of that group, more than a quarter of the Senate – 28 members – can trace their families to at least one slaveholder.\n",
      "Those lawmakers from the 117th session of Congress are Democrats and Republicans alike. They include some of the most influential politicians in America: Republican senators Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham, Tom Cotton and James Lankford, and Democrats Elizabeth Warren, Tammy Duckworth, Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan.\n",
      "In addition, President Joe Biden and every living former U.S. president – except Donald Trump – are direct descendants of slaveholders: Jimmy Carter, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and – through his white mother’s side – Barack Obama. Trump’s ancestors came to America after slavery was abolished.\n",

      "And in 2022, the governors of 11 of the 50 U.S. states were descendants of slaveholders, Reuters found. They include eight chief executives of the 11 states that formed the Confederate States of America, which seceded and waged war to preserve slavery. Two are seeking the Republican nomination for president: Asa Hutchinson, former governor of Arkansas, and Doug Burgum of North Dakota.\n",
      "South Carolina, where the Civil War began, illustrates the familial ties between the American political elite and the nation’s history of slavery. Every member of the state’s nine-person delegation to the last Congress has an ancestral link. The state’s two Black members of Congress – Senator and Republican presidential candidate Tim Scott and Representative James Clyburn, a powerful Democrat – have forebears who were enslaved. Each of the seven white lawmakers who served in the 117th Congress is a direct descendant of a slaveholder, Reuters found. So too is the state’s Republican governor, Henry McMaster. Reuters found that at least 8% of Democrats in the last Congress and 28% of Republicans have such ancestors. The preponderance of Republicans reflects the party’s strength in the South, where slavery was concentrated. Although white people enslaved Black people across Northern states\n",
      " in early America, by the eve of the Civil War, slavery was almost entirely a Southern enterprise.\n",
      "The Reuters examination reveals how intimately tied America remains to the institution of slavery, including through the “people who make the laws that govern our country,” said Henry Louis Gates Jr, a professor at Harvard University who focuses on African and African American research and hosts the popular television genealogy show Finding Your Roots on PBS.\n",

      "Gates said identifying those familial connections to slaveholders is “not another chapter in the blame game. We do not inherit guilt for our ancestors’ actions.”\n",
      "“It’s just to say: Look at how closely linked we are to the institution of slavery, and how it informed the lives of the ancestors of people who represent us in the United States Congress today,” Gates said. “This is a learning opportunity for each individual. It is also a learning opportunity for their constituency … and for the American people as a whole.”\n",
      "In addition to the political leaders Reuters identified, “there are millions of Americans who are descendants of enslavers as well,” said Tony Burroughs, a genealogist who specializes in helping Black Americans trace their ancestries.\n",
      "What’s unclear is how the proportion of leaders who descend from slaveholders compares to that of all Americans. Among scholars, there is no agreement on precisely how many Americans today have a forebear who enslaved people.\n",

      "Ancestral ties to slaveholders have been documented previously for a handful of leaders, including Biden, Obama and McConnell. Scholars and journalists have also extensively examined slavery and its legacy, including how the North profited from the institution, and the role slavery played in decisions of past political leaders during the formation of America and after emancipation.\n",
      "The Reuters examination is different. It focuses on the most powerful U.S. officeholders of today, many of whom have staked key positions on policies related to race. It reveals for the first time, in breadth and in detail, the extent of those leaders’ ancestral connections to what’s commonly called America’s “original sin.” And it explores what it may mean for them to learn – in personal, specific and sometimes graphic ways – the facts behind their own kin’s part in slavery.\n",

Among the silent are politicians who previously have spoken publicly, sometimes eloquently, about the legacy of slavery and the need for racial healing. The reticence underscores the enduring sensitivity of slavery as a political issue, an unease that genealogist Burroughs suggests is greatly amplified for many people when one’s own kin are linked to the brutal institution.\n",
      "“You probably have a lot of people who are struggling” to process the information about their families, said Burroughs. He said the granular detail Reuters provided the leaders – names, places and circumstances linking their families to slavery – makes the information especially powerful. “But it’s hard for them to be in denial when they have the specific facts in front of them.”\n",

Duckworth described the facts Reuters unearthed as “gut-wrenching.” In an 1829 appraisal of the estate of her ancestor, Henry Coe, the names of the enslaved – and their assessed dollar values – are bookended by farm animals: seven sheep and a lamb, and a bull calf.\n",
      "Coe left to various family members “my negro woman Margaret until she shall arrive at the age of forty years, and my negro boy Isaac until he is thirty-six years old, also my negro boy Warner until he is thirty-six years old …” and “my negro boy George … till he is thirty-six years old.” The will said that each would be freed when reaching the stated age. Reuters could not determine what became of three of the enslaved. But a Freedom Suit in Virginia in 1858 shows that Isaac Franklin – the child named Isaac mentioned in the Coe will – sought emancipation at age 36. By the 1860 census, he was listed in Frederick County, Virginia, living as a free man and working as a blacksmith.\n",

      "One member of the 117th Congress with a slaveholding ancestor, former Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama, questioned what the country has to gain from revisiting the topic.\n",
      "“Hopefully, everybody in America is smart enough to know that slavery is abhorrent,” Brooks, who lost a U.S. Senate bid last year, said in a phone interview. “So the question then becomes, if everybody already knows that it’s abhorrent, what more can you teach from that?”\n",
      "Scholars say that establishing the grim details of the history of slavery is essential to understanding the nation’s past and bridging racial divides.\n",
      "“There’s a kind of moral value to documenting this crime and acknowledging that happened, and getting into specifics about what its nature was, and that involves saying who was involved,” said Sean Kelley, an American-born professor at the University of Essex who specializes in the transatlantic slave trade.\n",
      "Knowing those specifics is crucial, Kelley said, “if there’s to be a reconciliation of some kind, racially, in the United States.”\n",
      "The Reuters/Ipsos survey offers some support for that view, too: It suggests that, for some Americans, knowing of an ancestor’s involvement in slavery can shape views on controversial policy questions.\n",
      "White respondents who said they’re aware of having a slaveholding ancestor were more likely than other white people to support paying reparations: 42% backed the idea, compared to 24% who said their ancestors did not enslave people. The same held true for the idea of having Congress create a commission to formally apologize for slavery: 53% of white people who said they knew of an ancestral tie to slaveholding supported it, versus 39% of those who said their families had not enslaved people.\n",

      "Genealogists say white people who excavate their ancestry could help Black Americans by finding information that enables them to trace their own ancestries. Black genealogy faces a special hurdle: Before 1870, census takers almost never recorded the names of the enslaved in the United States, instead listing ages and genders.\n",
      "In researching America’s political elite, Reuters found names – almost always just a first name – of 712 people enslaved by the ancestors of the political elite. Even with a first name, tracing those individuals forward to a census where they are recorded in full is often exceedingly difficult. But white families may have other documents – such as wills, plantation records or family Bibles that list the names of the enslaved – or know where to find them.\n",
      "“People don’t realize how many documents are still in the family,” said genealogist Burroughs. He asked the leaders identified by Reuters to “go back and review their family archives, and see what documents they have pertaining to slavery and make them available to the public. That will help tremendously.” Those documents could be shared with a university library, a local or state historical society or other archives, genealogists say. \n",

      "Most ancestors of members of Congress typified the medium-scale slaveholders of the antebellum South. An analysis of census data shows that in 1860, on the eve of the Civil War, the average number of people who congressional ancestors enslaved was slightly larger than for the average slaveholder: about 15 people per forebear, compared with an average of 10 across the South. Most Southern slaveholders enslaved fewer than 10 people, however. The average was pulled higher by a comparatively small number of landowners who held larger numbers of people in captivity.\n",

      "In looking at the members of Congress whose ancestors were slaveholders, Reuters found that some of these families, too, recovered financially by 1940. But limitations in census data make it difficult to track wealth after 1870.\n",

      "Joe Wilson is the Republican Congressman from South Carolina who famously shouted “You lie!” at America’s first Black president, Barack Obama, during a joint session of Congress in 2009. Wilson has at least five slaveholders among his forebears. His ancestors first enslaved Black people during the 1700s, Reuters found. Among the slaveholders was Wilson’s great-great-grandfather, Stephen H. Boineau. In 1860, he enslaved 16 people, ranging from an 8-month-old girl to a 50-year-old man. Boineau also worked for another enslaver as an overseer – a man who enforced plantation rules and monitored the conduct of the enslaved.\n",
      "Wilson did not respond to five requests for comment.\n",
      "For most of his adult life, he has spoken passionately about the importance of heritage and history in both personal and political terms. In doing so, he has demonstrated a deep curiosity about his genealogy.\n",

      "During a speech at the South Carolina General Assembly in 2000, a year before being elected to Congress, Wilson said keeping the Confederate flag flying at the statehouse was “very, very personal. And it’s personal because it’s my family,” he said. “For me, it began very early in that I was named for a Confederate general, General David Addison Weisiger.”\n",
      "In that speech, Wilson – whose given name is Addison Graves Wilson – noted that ancestor Weisiger “was not a plantation owner; he was a bank cashier.” Wilson didn’t mention that Weisiger, an uncle of his great-great-grandmother, nevertheless enslaved seven people in southeast Virginia in 1860. They ranged in age from 5 to 45.\n",
      "In 2009, the Congressional Record shows a statement from Wilson about his German heritage. Wilson mentioned the name of an ancestor, Daniel Weisiger, who he said was born in Frankfurt, Germany, and immigrated to Pennsylvania in 1731 before settling in Chesterfield County, Virginia.\n",
      "Reuters found that one of Wilson’s Weisiger ancestors was a slaveholder in 1786. A tax book for Chesterfield County shows Daniel Weisiger’s son, Samuel, having five “negroes” on a form that also listed his cattle and horses. Samuel Weisiger gave his son the same name as his father: Daniel. In 1830, son Daniel Weisiger held 15 enslaved people, according to the census.\n",

      "One of the few Republican lawmakers who addressed his family’s ties to slavery was Brooks. He represented an Alabama district in the House of Representatives for 12 years until he lost a bid for the Senate last year.\n",
      "In an interview, Brooks said he hadn’t known that his ancestor, great-great-great-grandfather Thomas Ferguson, was a slaveholder. The farmer held one person – a 7-year-old boy – in bondage in Haywood County, North Carolina, according to the 1860 slave schedule. Reuters could find no records that show what became of the child’s parents. Had they died? Or was the family separated, sold piecemeal to other slaveholders?\n",
      "Brooks wondered whether there might be a happier story behind why the boy was listed on the schedule. “It is hard to envision what kind of labor a 7-year-old boy could do to offset the food, shelter, clothing costs of that 7-year-old boy. Which raises the issue of whether this ancestor had the boy in his possession in a traditional slavery sense, or was intending to set that boy free once he reached the age of majority,” Brooks said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manumission was “highly unusual,” said historian Marie Jenkins Schwartz, author of Born in Bondage: Growing Up Enslaved in the Antebellum South. “By the age of 7, an enslaved child would be expected to be productive,” potentially helping around the slaveholder’s house, watching their children, and learning agricultural or other adult jobs, she said. “They certainly didn’t have a life of leisure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When he was in Congress, Brooks was one of 14 members who voted against making Juneteenth a national holiday. Brooks told Reuters that he preferred such a holiday be on a day he considered to be of broader national significance, such as when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed. In addition, Brooks said he also was concerned about the cost of adding a federal holiday without eliminating a current one.\n",
      "In June 2021, Brooks co-sponsored a bill called the Saving American History Act.\n",
      "The bill directs that federal funding be withheld from schools that wish to teach materials based on the New York Times’ 1619 Project, a series of essays about the founding of America that argued the start of African slavery that year wasn’t just the country’s original sin but “as important to the American story as 1776,” the year the United States declared independence. The scholarship of the series has been hailed by some professional historians and criticized by others. The bill didn’t make it to the House floor for a vote.\n",
      "“The Federal Government,” the bill reads, “has a strong interest in promoting an accurate account of the Nation’s history through public schools and forming young people into knowledgeable and patriotic citizens.”\n",
      "“It’s always good to know history,” Brooks told Reuters.\n",
      "Asked about his view on reparations, Brooks said the country has already paid one form of restitution, through a Civil War-era program proposed by Union General William Tecumseh Sherman.\n",
      "“You may remember – what was it – 40 acres and a mule?” Brooks asked. “Now I’d have to check my history on how prevalent that was. But some freed slaves were given some amount of reparations, if my memory serves me correctly, and that is the origin of the phrase ‘40 acres and a mule.’”\n",

      "As Harvard’s Gates wrote, Sherman did issue a special order in 1865 calling for liberated families under his protection to be issued land and, later, a mule. The property in question was a strip of land down the country’s southeastern coast.\n",
      "Had the order been followed, it would have provided Black Americans assets upon which to build new lives and perhaps pass wealth to subsequent generations.\n",
      "But the program ended quickly, Gates wrote. President Andrew Johnson, the Southern sympathizer who succeeded Abraham Lincoln, “overturned the Order in the fall of 1865” and returned the land “to the very people who had declared war on the United States of America.”\n",
      "The United States has never paid restitution for slavery.\n",
      "‘A Better Nation’\n",
      "Some historians and genealogists say there is a valuable reason for white leaders – and other white Americans – to explore their links to slavery.\n",
      "Many white families may have records that are not in the public domain – documents that could help Black Americans trace their own ancestries to before 1870, when the formerly enslaved were first recorded by name in the U.S. census. Before emancipation, the historical record bears scant detailed traces of individual Black Americans. Not so for white people: Old letters, family Bibles, or other records left behind by white Americans hold the potential to unlock mysteries for the descendants of the 3.9 million Black Americans who were enslaved at the start of the Civil War.\n",

(Her suggestion is to upload them to Ancestry.com, where others researching the same family can find them. The site requires a subscription.) More and more Americans are interested in genealogy, she said, and they think, “‘Oh, my gosh, I might be holding on to something in my house that other people need to even make a connection with their ancestors.’”\n",
      "That shared effort might bring a divided country closer, said board-certified genealogist LaBrenda Garrett-Nelson.\n",
      "Garrett-Nelson, who worked with Reuters to review its reporting, said generations of Americans “were socialized to think of African-descended families as people who had no history worth remembering.” She is a current trustee and former president of the board of trustees for the Board for Certification of Genealogists.\n",
      "“We as genealogists can play a role in helping our country move toward a process of true reconciliation, something that cannot happen until we honestly face the past,” she said.\n",

Among the papers a reporter shared with Larsen was an 1828 will left by his ancestor, John Wiggins. Unlike the U.S. census forms during that era, which gave only the numbers of enslaved people held by a household, the will listed names – a fact Larsen highlighted in a statement to Reuters.\n",

It may be difficult to document their family tree, yet I truly hope there is a record of their lives where their descendants thrived in this country as whole persons with the human dignity they deserved.” Reuters could find no record of the three in the 1870 census.\n",

The top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Meeks said in an interview that he has spent years trying to trace his family history back before 1870.\n",
      "Meeks grew up in New York but spent summers in South Carolina, where his parents were from. Born in 1953, he said he remembers traces of the Jim Crow South during his visits. His grandfather once ordered him to hide under the bed because of rumors the Ku Klux Klan was coming through York County.\n",

      "Meeks said he has talked about family heritage with one of his white congressional colleagues, who “goes all the way back to the 1600s with his family … I’m jealous of that, because I don’t have any ability to do that, but he can talk about his family and have a history, a record of them – and I’d like to be able to do that also.”\n",
      "About 15 years ago, Meeks said, he took a DNA test that showed his family came from the Mende people of Sierra Leone. Last year, he led a congressional delegation to Africa. In Sierra Leone, the lawmakers stopped at Bunce Island, a former slave-trading port.\n",
      "“It was the most emotional moment for me on the trip,” Meeks said. “All you can do is sit and pray to God and close your eyes, which is what I did, knowing that my ancestors were whipped, put in chains and put into the hulls of slave ships.”\n",
      "Meeks said he plans to keep searching for the details of his ancestors’ story so he can share it with his grandchildren and “tell the truth of what took place with our family, how they made it through slavery.”\n",
      "That way, Meeks said, they can “be proud of what we had to overcome in this country, to be a part of it and to make it a better nation.”\n",

REUTERS/Kamil Krzaczynski/File PhotoCompaniesFord Motor CoFollowCarparts.Com IncFollowWASHINGTON, June 24 (Reuters) - U.S. auto safety regulators said on Saturday they are investigating Ford Motor's (F.N) prior recalls of 710,000 Explorer SUVs over power loss reports to determine if the fix is adequate.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) noted the No. 2 U.S. automaker issued recalls in April 2022 and March on Ford Explorer SUVs from the 2020-2022 model years to address a rear axle horizontal mounting bolt that may fracture and cause the driveshaft to disconnect.Ford said earlier its recalls were to address a disconnected driveshaft that could result in the vehicle rolling away placed in 'Park' without the parking brake applied, increasing the risk of a crash.Ford did not immediately comment Saturday but said in March it was not aware of any crashes or injuries tied to the recall issue.Ford’s fix is to add a software update that automatically applies the electronic service parking brake to keep the vehicle from rolling away, the agency said, adding there is no remedy to address the failed rear axle horizontal mounting bolt \"which is the basis of this safety issue and the cause of the impaired vehicle.\"NHTSA said it has received two complaints alleging a loss of power or transmission torque of the rear wheels in Explorer vehicles that had received the recall fix.One complaint told NHTSA that after getting the software update \"the vehicle would randomly slam to a complete stop while driving. It happened several times with three different drivers (myself, my wife, and my son), each happening at 30-35 mph or less.\"Reporting by David Shepardson\n",

      "For service companies that experience a summer slowdown every year, finding ways to keep staff members productive during this time is crucial for maintaining momentum and utilizing resources effectively. While customer or client work may decrease, there are many valuable activities that employees can engage in to make the most of their and the company’s time.\n",

      "Here, 18 Forbes Coaches Council members highlight strategies companies can use to ensure teams remain productive during the summertime. From professional development and skills training to brainstorming sessions to make process improvements and enhance internal operations, check out the various avenues service companies can take to help team members focus their efforts in the most beneficial ways when business is slow below.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Focus On Free Professional Development\n",
      "During a summer slowdown, service companies can keep staff productive by focusing on free professional development, process improvement, research, team building, creative projects, networking and free employee well-being initiatives. These activities maximize employee engagement and contribute to long-term growth. - Foluso Gbadamosi, FolusoGbadamosi.com\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Evaluate What Can Be Improved\n",
      "I love saying, “Go slow to go fast,” and summer slowdowns are a great time to invest in personal leadership development. Leadership starts with the person. Slow seasons are also great for evaluating which systems, tools or processes need to be revamped. Lastly, the gift of “free” vacation time for employees (whether it is a day or more) from the company goes a long way to rejuvenate staff members for busy times. - Melissa DeLuca, DeLuca & Willow\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Reflect On What Has Gone Well And Not So Well\n",
      "During a summer slowdown, I would focus on three specific things: Take time to reflect on what has gone well, what hasn’t gone so well and what we can take forward. There is energy that can be taken from reminding ourselves of our success, and learning is invaluable for growth. Second, sharpen the saw and focus on personal development. Finally, I would look at high-impact, short-burst projects to set us up for success. - Ricky Muddimer, Thinking Focus\n",

      "4. Maximize Employees’ Talent\n",
      "Ask employees what they want to contribute in specific areas of the business that will further a certain strategic goal, and then agree on the parameters. This will keep them engaged and excited to be contributing to a valuable, possibly new function for when the business will be back in the swing of things! - Cellene Hoogenkamp, KokuaHub Inc\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Prepare To Cope With Future Challenges\n",
      "A popular saying advises that “you have to redo your roof when the weather is nice!” A business slowdown is a very good time to step back from the daily routines and do a strategic review of activities. Here are some questions to answer: “Are we prepared for the next challenges? Are we investing enough in people, technologies and innovation to cope with future challenges, both ecological and social?” - Catherine Tanneau, Activision Coaching Institute\n",

      "6. Get Strategic And Build New, Faster Systems\n",
      "When business is slow, get strategic! Any slowdown is a perfect time to invest in building new systems to handle scale and speed. When you have space in the calendar is the time to build templates, processes and business continuity systems, as well as purge inventory and document libraries. Slow times are when you lay the foundation to make the faster times smooth! - David Taylor-Klaus, MCC, CPCC, CTPC, DTK Coaching, LLC\n",
      "7. Brainstorm Future Services\n",
      "During slowdowns, companies get an incredible opportunity to work on building their team, planning forward, brainstorming future services, reviewing their current processes, testing services for validation and training on new skills that the team may need. This opportunity allows for great growth inside a company if used wisely. - Bobbie Goheen, Synthesis Management Group\n",
      "8. Tie Up Loose Ends, Then Rest And Recharge\n",
      "There is an ebb and flow in life and in business. The key here is to understand that everything is cyclical and change is always around the corner. I encourage my clients to take advantage of the slower times and work on the business by tying up loose ends, getting organized in-house, strategizing on business development and doing some fun team-building activities. Rest and recharge for the busy season—it’s coming! - Cheryl Keates, PCC, Cheryl Keates\n",
      "9. Conduct Team-Building Activities\n",
      "A slow period is the perfect time to evaluate the efficiency of the business. Looking at department policies, processes and service offerings to determine if any changes are necessary will allow the company to help more customers during the busy season. This is also a great time for team building through volunteer days, cleaning the space, and training and development. - Lindsay Miller, Reverie Organizational Development Specialists\n",
      "10. Focus On Meeting Training Goals\n",
      "Focusing on meeting training goals for personal and professional development can effectively fill the time during a summer slowdown for service-based companies. This reminds employees they have the power to move the needle in their career trajectories and builds their growth mindset. - Ariel McGrew, Tactful Disruption®\n",
      "11. Cross-Train Employees\n",
      "One of the strategies that companies can use to keep their staff members productive during the summertime is to cross-train employees. By teaching staff members new skills or having them work in different areas of the business, you can help them stay motivated and prevent boredom or burnout. It is also a great way to keep them engaged and productive when facing a summer slowdown. - Paula Vidal Castelli, Paula Vidal Castelli Intl., LLC\n",
      "12. Hire A Development Trainer Or Facilitator\n",
      "A summer slowdown is the best period to use spare time for learning and development so that staff members can sharpen their skills and knowledge or learn new skills to be ready for the peak season. Hiring a trainer or facilitator can be a great way to ensure learning and development will not only benefit personal growth, but also business growth. - Senem Anataca, 180UTC\n",
      "13. Work On Improving Internal Operations\n",
      "One of my favorite quotes is, “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems,” by James Clear. If there is downtime, businesses should always be working on improving internal operations, such as processes, IT systems and so forth. This will not only likely save the business money, but it also will increase the engagement of your team. - Wendy Fong, Chief Gigs\n",
      "14. Conduct Market And User Research\n",
      "Here are three ways companies can take advantage of slow times during the summer: 1. Hire a training company to train staff on new systems, such as AI technologies. 2. Carry out business process improvement initiatives by mapping out, analyzing and improving existing processes. 3. Conduct market and user research—review all customer databases as well as competitors’ data, and create an improvement action plan for the busy periods. - Eno Eka, The Business Analysis School\n",
      "15. Innovate And Collaborate\n",
      "A summer slowdown allows for space to create. Task your staff with working on projects that set their hearts on fire and are of high service to your clients. Test out a new offering. Connect with your best customers. If you can do this as a team, even better! - Amy Pocsik, Bold Moves\n",
      "16. Reflect On Where You Are And Start A Passion Project\n",
      "A common frustration I hear from successful people is that they struggle to make time for strategic thinking. A natural slow point is perfect for reflecting on your direction of travel and on the balance you’re striking. How do you really feel about the life you are creating? Where do you want to course-correct? Then use passion projects as a vehicle for indulging and expanding your capabilities. - Duncan Skelton, Duncan Skelton Coaching Ltd\n",
      "17. Create New Products And Better Services\n",
      "Use the benefit of downtime to create new products and better services and to provide opportunities for your team to develop new skills. When the clients are ready, your team will also be ready to provide new and better services for your clients! - Cindy Lamir, Impact Business Coaches\n",
      "18. Encourage And Allow Employees To Take More PTO\n",
      "Companies should be encouraging teams to take paid time off with family and friends during the summer months. Research shows that offering sabbaticals is the best way to get people to return to the office refreshed, more grateful and more productive than they were before they left. So, organizations should allow more time off in the summer so that employees come back refreshed and do their best work. - Carmelina Piedra, CareerCoachingPro\n",

      "Amid a slew of allegations of physical and emotional abuse against romantic partners and toxicity on film sets, Jonathan Majors’ lawyers say his “Method acting”—an immersive acting process that some swear by, but critics say can be bothersome and disruptive for coworkers—may have been misconstrued as rudeness on film sets.\n",
      "Jonathan Majors will appear in court in August after being charged with assault and aggravated ... [+] harassment. Hope he doesn’t stay “in character.”Cindy Ord/VF23/Getty Images for Vanity Fair\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Facts\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Method acting, also known as “The Method,” based on the early 1900s teachings of Russian director Konstantin Stanislavski and popularized in the United States by director Lee Strasberg, is a technique in which actors “use their physical, mental and emotional self in the creation of a character” to achieve an authentic performance, according to the Lee Strasberg Institute.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some celebrated Method acting performances include Strasberg student Robert De Niro’s work in Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, for the latter of which he gained 60 pounds to play a retired boxer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The modern understanding of Method acting has diverted from Stanislavski’s original teachings, according to i-D Magazine, which reported that Method acting is now associated with never breaking character and going to great lengths to fully inhabit characters, which has become popularized by the media.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some modern Method actors who choose to live as their characters on- and off-camera have garnered criticism for disruptive on-set behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jared Leto’s Method techniques have frequently made headlines, including an instance while filming Suicide Squad (2016), in which he starred as the Joker, when he sent co-stars Margot Robbie and Viola Davis a live rat and a dead pig, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Other infamous Method acting techniques include Leonardo DiCaprio sleeping in an animal carcass for The Revenant and Daniel Day-Lewis being pushed around in a wheelchair and spoon-fed by the crew of My Left Foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some non-Method actors who have worked with Method actors say their process makes the work environment more difficult, like Martin Freeman, who called his Man on the Moon co-star Jim Carrey’s Method acting process “self-aggrandizing, selfish” and “narcissistic.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Chief Critics\n",
      "In conversation with Jennifer Lopez for the Variety Studio: Actors on Actors series, Robert Pattinson said: “You only ever see people do the Method when they’re playing assholes. You never see someone being lovely to everyone while they’re really deep in character.” Lopez agreed, stating after years of making movies she often can’t wait to go home and let go of her characters. Sebastian Stan said Method acting “reads like an irresponsible, narcissistic thing. It reads like, ‘I’m afraid, and I want to torture everyone else because of it.’” Some have also criticized modern conceptions of Method acting for straying from Stanislavski’s teachings. Jon Bernthal said he doesn’t see the benefit of Method acting, but criticized how far the technique has strayed from Stanislavski’s teachings: “Making everybody call you by your character name and not showering for eight months was not what Stanislavski had in mind with the Method,” he told the Hollywood Reporter last year. Will Poulter criticized actors using Method acting “as an excuse for inappropriate behavior,” stating an actor’s process shouldn’t infringe on other people’s work environment. Jeremy Strong, star of the HBO hit Succession, made headlines for comments from co-workers about his intense process on the set (which he does not consider Method), which Kieran Culkin said “doesn’t help me” and Brian Cox called “f——- annoying,” adding he worries about what it does to him mentally.\n",

      "Andrew Garfield defended Method acting last year, stating it is “not about being an asshole to everyone on set. It’s actually just about living truthfully under imagined circumstances.” He criticized misconceptions of Method acting and stated the technique helped him on the 2016 film Silence. Some stars, including Strong and Tony Kushner, defended Method actor Daniel Day-Lewis, who famously goes to great lengths for his roles, both of who worked with him on Lincoln. After a New Yorker article detailing Strong’s immersive acting process went viral, Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway defended his process. “When we talk about process, when we talk about intensity, when we talk about Method, when we talk about all this stuff, it’s all good to me. Nothing ever strikes me as weird,” Hathaway said.\n",
      "Key Background\n",
      "Majors, who maintains he is innocent, was arrested in March on charges of strangulation, assault and harassment of a 30-year-old woman, who referred to Majors as her partner in text messages shared with TMZ by Majors’ attorney Priya Chaudry. Multiple alleged abuse victims of Majors have since come forward and cooperated with legal authorities, and Majors was subsequently dropped by talent agency Entertainment 360 and PR firm The Lede Co. He also lost several film roles, including the upcoming film adaptation of the Walter Mosley novel The Man in My Basement, in which he was supposed to star and serve as executive producer, as well as an Otis Redding biopic. Majors appeared in court in June for a hearing in which his trial date was set for August 3. A Rolling Stone investigation published Thursday, based on interviews with more than 40 sources granted anonymity, alleges that Majors physically abused one romantic partner, emotionally abused two romantic partners and treated crew members on film sets poorly. Majors’ attorney denied the allegations raised in the Rolling Stone article. “Everyone who has worked with Mr. Majors knows that he employs an immersive Method acting style, and while that can be misconstrued as rudeness at times, those who know Mr. Majors and work in the industry have attested to his dedication to his craft as well as his kindness,” his lawyer Dustin Pusch told IndieWire.\n",

      "watch nowVIDEO3:2603:26Gay men face more challenges and higher costs to start familySquawk BoxBret Shuford and Stephen Hanna knew from early on in their relationship they wanted to raise a child together. But the married couple didn't think a biological child was a possibility.As freelancers in the creative arts, Shuford and Hanna don't always see steady income, even when working on Broadway. The Houston-based couple, known as the \"Broadway Husbands,\" thought having a child with a donor egg and gestational carrier \"seemed like it was something that was only available to people who were very wealthy,\" said Shuford, 44.It's a safe assumption that having a child with a surrogate, now most often called a gestational carrier, is cost-prohibitive. While expenses vary widely due to a number of medical and legal factors, \"the average cost of surrogacy in America has gone from $75,000 five years ago, to anywhere between $150,000 and $250,000 today,\" according to Dr. Brian Levine, a reproductive endocrinologist who founded surrogacy matching platform Nodal.More from Personal Finance:How LGBTQ+ seniors can tackle their special caregiving challengesFinancial advisor: Here are 4 important money tips for parents with young kidsTeenagers are in high demand as summer hiring surge gets under wayIn the U.S., there are only about 5,000 successful surrogacy journeys per year, Nodal estimates.\"That's only about 8% of met need,\" Levine said. \"In plain English, 92% of the people that dream of starting or growing or completing a family with surrogacy will not be able to do so in America due to the sheer time and cost constraints that are there today.\"Why gay male couples face higher costsAlon Rivel, left, with his family.Courtesy Alon RivelAlon Rivel always wanted to be a father. \"As I grew up, I realized I was gay,\" said Rivel, 34. \"So I thought, this will never happen for me. I don't have the money, but I wanted it desperately.\"\"We were shocked when we started to look into [having a biological child] and realized nothing is covered by insurance unless you can prove that you're infertile,\" said Rivel, who lives in Arlington, Massachusetts. He and his husband believed that \"this is complete discrimination on the insurance company's part because we are gay men.\"\"It is not a choice,\" Rivel added. \"We were born this way and, thus, we are actually infertile.\"Experts say the demand for surrogacy relationships has grown since same-sex marriage became legal in the U.S. in 2015.Gay male couples typically face a more expensive journey, as surrogacy or adoption are their primary choices. In contrast, same-sex female couples are often able to carry pregnancies to term on their own, though they may possibly have to pay for donor sperm and fertilization.Sadly, we do see in some states that there are laws that discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community.Betsy Campbellchief engagement officer for Resolve: The National Infertility AssociationDonor eggs are exponentially more expensive than donor sperm largely because the egg retrieval process is more invasive and complicated. While costs, again, vary wildly, donor eggs and the associated costs can range between $20,000 and $60,000, according to fertility marketplace GoStork, while donor sperm can be from as little as several hundred dollars to around $1,000.Donor eggs, meanwhile, are only one of many expenses.Shuford and Hanna's health insurance covered only the tests done on their sperm samples. Their remaining expenses, they estimate, ran between $150,000 and $180,000. That included around $40,000 for donor eggs, the medical costs to create, store, test and freeze embryos, medical insurance and out-of-pocket medical costs for their gestational carrier, her compensation, and other expenses.The couple used savings, credit cards and high-interest loans to cover that tab. Rivel and his husband's journey to parenthood ultimately cost $220,000.\"We're taking money away from our child's college fund,\" he said. \"We're taking money away from our mortgage.\"\"Compared to [many of] our friends, our baseline is $200,000 below where they started,\" Rivel added.Employer fertility benefits offer limited helpMore employers are starting to offer fertility benefits, often through a specialized fertility benefits manager such as Kindbody, Carrot, Progyny or Maven. In 2022, 40% of U.S. employers offered some type of fertility coverage, up from 30% in 2020, according to the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans.Fertility IQ, which keeps a workplace index of employer fertility benefits, found the average amount of fertility coverage in 2021 was $36,000 per lifetime, flat from the year before.But while more companies are offering fertility benefits, many of these packages are limited when it comes to covering what's needed to build families using non-traditional methods. Almost two-thirds, 63%, of LGBTQ+ people plan to use assisted reproductive technology, foster care or adoption to become parents, according to a survey by Family Equality.Yet fewer than half of employers offering fertility benefits provided any benefits for adoption, and only about 10% provided benefits related to surrogacy, according to a 2021 survey from Resolve: The National Infertility Association and health-care consultancy Mercer. And state laws requiring employers of a certain size to offer fertility benefits often leave out coverage for third-party reproduction such as a gestational carrier or the purchase of donor eggs or donor sperm.\"I honestly believe that employers don't realize there is a gap in their benefits. And they often don't know this until an employee points that out,\" said Betsy Campbell, chief engagement officer for Resolve.She said many employers she speaks to have \"the best intentions\" but don't understand how gestational surrogacy works or how family building benefits fall short.Will Porteous, 39, became a father through gestational surrogacy before joining Maven as its chief growth officer. He and his husband tabulated their parenthood path cost at close to $175,000. \"No employer in the entire country that I'm aware of offers anything greater than $75,000 a year, and so that only covers a portion.\" Will Porteous, right, with his husband, Doug, and their son, Walter.Courtesy Will PorteousBut Porteous, who lives in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, said full coverage isn't necessarily what LGBTQ+ couples want to see. \"The expectation is to have equitable support to your other co-workers and seeing that your employer cares about that journey,\" he said.That employer support, Porteous said, \"really means a lot and it shows that you as an employer care about your employee, regardless of how they're going to build their family.\"Fertility benefits can help recruit, retain talentWhile fertility benefits manager Progyny's first clients were largely West Coast \"Silicon Valley-type\" businesses, according to CEO Pete Anevski, it now works with employers in 40 industries.\"There's a flywheel effect happening,\" he said, with more companies realizing benefits need to include family-building coverage \"to be competitive, to attract and retain talent in what is still a tight labor market, an inflationary economy, even with concerns around a looming recession.\" Fertility benefits manager Carrot said it has around 800 corporate clients and 80% of those offer their employees a benefit for surrogacy. \"We have seen an increase in surrogacy claims year over year at about 250%,\" said CEO Tammy Sun. Offering these types of benefits can be key factors for a company when job candidates are making decisions about employment, said Taryn Branca, chief revenue officer at Kindbody.\"I can't tell you how many of our clients will call us, we will get on the phone with potential candidates that they're recruiting, or we will provide information to support that recruit coming there because they are asking for very specific information before they'll accept the offer: if they have surrogacy benefits, if they have donor benefits,\" she said.More than half of respondents in a new Progyny survey of LGBTQ+ community members said they are actively looking to build their families. Of that population, 79% would consider leaving their current job for one that offers better fertility and family-building benefits, and 80% would consider taking a second job to receive those benefits.\"This is not a 'nice to have,' this is a 'need to have' benefit,\" Anevski said.Rivel's husband is an early employee at Massachusetts-based Beam Therapeutics. At Rivel's insistence, he asked his human resources department to look into including surrogacy benefits. Eventually, the company added a surrogacy reimbursement benefit, which at the time Rivel and his husband used it was worth $10,000. While $10,000 was a small dent in the couple's $220,000 surrogacy journey, Rivel said it's better than nothing. \"It's really admirable that they have it,\" he said. \"I think it's a really smart benefit for recruiting more people.\"Adoption also comes with high costs, risksAdoption is certainly another family-building option. \"It's not for everyone ... it's not without its costs, and the laws vary by state,\" Resolve's Campbell said. \"Sadly, we do see in some states that there are laws that discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community, so that's definitely a consideration.\"The average nonfoster-system adoption costs between $25,000 and $60,000, according to the Child Welfare Information Gateway. As with surrogacy relationships, the adopting parents cover related expenses for all parties, from medical to legal, plus living expenses if a match is made in advance of a birth. And, of course, there are no guarantees.Shuford and Hanna decided adoption wasn't a path for them. \"There's a lot of risks involved that we weren't willing to take,\" Hanna said. \"We had heard of stories involving birth mothers changing their minds, and children having birth defects that without [genetic embryo testing] weren't known.\"'It was totally worth it'Stephen Hanna, left, with his husband, Bret Shuford, and their son, Maverick.Courtesy Bret Shuford and Stephen HannaLike many gestational carrier stories, Shuford and Hanna's was far from easy or straightforward.Their first carrier dropped out of the process shortly before the embryo transfer was scheduled to take place but well after contracts had been signed and medical assessments and travel had occurred. The Covid-19 pandemic delayed the process with their second gestational carrier; then, after the first embryo transfer, the pregnancy ended in a devastating miscarriage. The second embryo transfer worked, and their surrogate gave birth to their son, Maverick, in 2022.\"So many times, we felt very excluded,\" Shuford said. \"We want to be able to have a family and raise our child and have that child be biologically related to us, and we have a right to do that, and we have a right to feel seen and validated in that process.\"But for Shuford, \"in the end, it was totally worth it.\"\"I mean, Maverick is amazing,\" he added. \"And we're so lucky to have a healthy baby and also having someone like Crystal, our surrogate who carried our child.\"\"I don't know that I've ever experienced that kind of love in my life,\" Shuford said. \"So it's really a powerful experience.\" \n",

      "My relationship with wellness is more complicated than running into a guy I ghosted at an office party. I began my journey in 2017 as a lot of people do: dressed in Lululemon and sipping green juice on my way to a yoga class. (I had chosen trap classes because I was much more comfortable hearing “Mouth Full of Golds” during child’s pose than risking stepping on a white woman’s yoga mat.) Soon, wellness became a capitalistic pursuit I held near. I loved grabbing a blue spirulina smoothie while out on a run — but only dressed in head-to-toe Nike gear. Lulu was for the gym and yoga. I became obsessed with rings, namely, closing the ones on my Apple Watch. \n",
      "By 2020, after spending thousands of dollars on this journey without seeing any measurable improvement in my mental health — which people do experience from wellness efforts — I began to interrogate why I expected this effort to cure my anxiety and depression. I was sidelined by the coronavirus pandemic and, like many others, began to question what actually mattered to me. Still, I did yoga, strength trained, cycled, and meditated at home to keep myself mentally afloat during the pandemic and during the antiracism protests over the murder of George Floyd, an immensely triggering moment for Black folks. Having a routine was helpful until it wasn’t. \n",
      "By 2022, I was experiencing weekly panic attacks that slowly increased to I-don’t-know-how-many-days a week. I wasn’t sleeping or moving much farther than from my bed to the couch. When I was eating, I wasn’t choosing nutritious foods. I’d run out of motivation to care for myself — and all of it felt like it shouldn’t be happening to me because I should be tougher.  \n",
      "Mainstream wellness was, to lean further into cliches, a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. I was actively pursuing better mental and physical health, a key piece of a wellness journey, but I wasn’t taking the time to establish what felt good to me. I was trying to fit into the trendiness of wellness, and I desperately wanted the freedom it proclaimed I could have if I bought enough stuff. Nowadays, I define wellness as, “Doing what feels good and aligns with what I believe I need in this moment.”\n",
      "My burnout story is a quintessential narrative among Black women. Many of us have been raised to be “strong” despite the systemic factors that make such an ideal impossible to uphold. The Strong Black Woman trope demands that we swallow our pain for the greater good of others, and it comes with grave psychological consequences. It can make us more susceptible to depression, anxiety, and feelings of isolation. For some Black women, we rarely forgive ourselves for our mistakes and relentlessly seek to meet others’ expectations. This is more harrowing when we consider that stress compounds. Besides causing headaches, chest pain, fatigue, and stomach issues, heightened stress levels can make sleeping impossible. Your breathing can quicken. You could develop high blood pressure, a weakened immune system, anxiety, depression, Type 2 diabetes, or memory loss — adverse health outcomes that Black people are more likely to experience. \n",
      "The systemic conditions that prevent Black women from being able to take proper care of ourselves is one of our nation’s most significant health injustices. And to add insult to our spiritual injury, wellness practices, which can be a useful tool to fight poor mental health, are presented to us through a Eurocentric, capitalist lens, encouraging us to spend money many of us don’t have on products we don’t need to care for ourselves. \n",
      "I discussed these conditions and the role wellness plays in navigating them with DeJa Love, the CEO of the Black Women’s Wellness Agency. Love’s agency supports Black women who are stressed, burnt out, and overwhelmed by connecting them to Black women wellness providers. This could be a yoga teacher, meditation or life coach, personal trainer, or any non-clinical wellness service that helps manage stress. \n",
      "“We have to go deeper because the world in which we’re living in, it’s not sustainable for us to keep at this pace,” Love says. “I really view this as a fierce urgency, as life or death. When Black birthing persons are dying at three times the rates of white folks, that’s a crisis. We are dying, across the board, at higher rates. This is why it’s so important.” \n",
      "This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. \n",
      "Explain your personal approach to wellness. Is it more spiritual? Or is it more political? \n",
      "For Black women, our wellness is infinite. That it is not a $200 yoga mat or yoga pants. Since, especially in the mainstream context of the United States — which is incredibly racist with white supremacist undertones — wellness is generally capitalistic. It’s about the doing, and the purchasing. \n",
      "Infinite wellness is knowing that maybe wellness for me in one moment is sitting in silence, sensory deprivation, not on social, not logged in, but sitting, connecting to breath, connecting to the divine spirit that guides us, whatever folks identify with. In the context of America, wellness is rest. It’s challenging a toxic grind culture that tells us we need to constantly produce, that we’re not enough, that we’re not doing enough. I’m guided by Tricia Hersey and her work. She leads The Nap Ministry, and her book Rest Is Resistance has really shifted my paradigm and informs a lot of what I view as wellness.\n",
      "What are some of those white supremacist undertones to wellness? \n",
      "It’s really this notion of, “I have to do something. I have to purchase something. I have to buy something. I have to keep performing.” And that can look like, “I need to buy the expensive mask. I need to buy expensive face serums. I need to go to the gym classes.” It’s still a perpetuation of grind culture and hyper-productivity. Whereas the Black Woman’s Wellness Agency and I challenge that and say, “Black women, you are enough by just being!” It seems so simple, but the brilliance is in the simplicity of being — not doing. Wellness is shifting our minds away from what we have been indoctrinated with, such as: “I have to be a certain weight, I have to look a certain way, I have to have this.” No. We have to be on the path of unlearning.\n",
      "Those are some of the undertones. It’s about this aesthetic, and that’s what we get. But wellness is not an aesthetic. Wellness is being connected to our breath, our bodies, and calming the mental fluctuations that happen constantly. \n",
      "This multibillion-dollar wellness industry that says you have to drink this or take this supplement or be in this intricate yoga posture just creates more work. \n",
      "Why isn’t wellness binary for Black women? I was looking on your website, and I saw that. I think I know what that means, but I’m very, very intrigued.\n",
      "It’s not binary because we, as Black women, are so robust. We have had to be. We’ve had to be the heads of households, to be cooks and cleaners, to raise children and make sure the finances are handled — we’re constantly wearing so many hats. Our healing and our wellness are not going to be boxed in. It can’t be, because we have to do so much. \n",
      "Black women are the largest demographic of advanced degree holders and business owners post-2020. We’re doing so much, and that’s why we’re proponents of wellness being whatever it is you need. \n",
      "If wellness is saying, “I’m just really tired, and I don’t need to push through,” then that’s wellness. If wellness is saying, “My family is expecting me to do something, and I say I can’t do that because I need to uphold my boundaries, and I can’t keep pouring from this empty cup,” then that’s wellness. That’s the journey that I’m still on. We’re all still on it. \n",
      "It has to be full-spectrum and incredibly inclusive. It has to counter the mainstream approach to wellness — the skinny white woman in Lululemon doing an intricate yoga posture. That is not true wellness; that is a capitalistic approach that we have been fed, and we have to keep pushing back because that image may not serve us. Now, we are not a monolith, so maybe that image serves some Black women. I know for many, though, that it does not.\n",
      "One thing that I think most Black women can all relate to is the pressure to fit into these spaces, whether it’s work or a yoga studio, where you’re the only Black person there, and people are looking at you crazy. So when we reclaim and reframe wellness — meaning we stop looking at it through this billion-dollar lens — how do we reconnect with our power? \n",
      "It’s multifaceted. It will take many different approaches. One of them is going for a walk and doing a walking meditation, not having your AirPods in, just listening to the sounds of nature so you can get out of your head and connect with the many thoughts that are going to come into your mind. I don’t want to demonize social media. It’s an amazing tool that connects us, but part of reclaiming is having healthy sabbaticals from social [media]. \n",
      "I’m also a proponent of therapy. Therapy helps us be introspective. \n",
      "Another thing that has helped me is being able to be free. Business ownership has allowed me to feel free. I’ve had an 18-year career in many business sectors, and within all of those sectors, you become indoctrinated, and your truth gets stifled by the dominant group. And even those who look like me can fall into assimilation and respectability. I speak unapologetically, and many people do not connect, and that’s fine. I’ve had to make peace with the fact that I may not get all the business contracts, or I may not gross the revenue that I want. But I can sleep at night knowing that I am speaking for Black women, that I am challenging inequities, the status quo, and a society that perpetuates it.\n",
      "You pointed out that when Black women really start taking care of ourselves, prioritizing our needs, and start centering our well-being, we lose people. It’s always been very interesting to me that when a Black woman starts thinking about her well-being versus how she can be in service to everyone else, people start dropping off. \n",
      "Earlier today, when I was on my walk, I was thinking about when we’re on journeys of evolution. I don’t want to be the same DeJa I was three years ago, a year ago. I want to be evolving, and learning, and there are folks that will not be there on that journey … it’s hard sometimes. It’s always the folks you don’t expect, the people who were always there. And that just hurts harder. Part of that evolution is releasing that attachment. And the folks that connect to me will find me. I will build a new community. \n",
      "It’s like my granny used to say, “Everybody can’t come.” Speaking of her — a Black woman who absolutely prioritized her well-being after raising three generations of her family — how does wellness help Black women thrive?\n",
      "It helps us because we are able to get reconnected with self. When I’m putting on my public health hat, our life expectancy is reduced in this white supremacist, very racist society. From medical racism in health care, housing, education, transportation — every facet that we intersect with has a huge impact on our outcome. Every facet of being in this country challenges us. Wellness helps us get back to our center when all of these forces that create the inequities we live in challenge us.\n",
      "Sometimes we will question ourselves. We forget the confidence, the power, the self-esteem, the self-efficacy because we have been metaphorically beaten down by all of these systems.\n",
      "We even have to combat the complicity of folks in our own communities and other white-adjacent folks of color. I know that’s a provocative notion. Black people and other folks of color can uphold white supremacy because we’re all stewed in the same society. So people get surprised, for instance, that a Black physician can perpetuate harm to their Black patients. They have been trained in racist medical schools, so they can perpetuate what they have been taught. That’s why wellness is so important. Wellness is whatever a Black woman needs. We know what we need for our healing, to feel grounded, to feel at peace, to feel centered. That is crucial as we navigate this society that we operate in.\n",
      "How does taking care of ourselves challenge hustle culture? Sometimes this strikes me as a conundrum. We’re trying to get out of this capitalistic dynamic of wellness, but we live in a capitalistic society, and we have to survive. And sometimes, for certain wellness practices, you have to buy something. It feels very sticky sometimes to see taking care of yourself as a challenge to capitalism when we live in a society where it’s so deeply entrenched.\n",

      "Again, I’m not immune from it. That’s why I’m so intentional with my unlearning, even as a business owner, challenging myself to not just push through. I’ll say: “DeJa, you’ve been up for how many hours? You’ve been in how many back-to-back meetings? Go out, take a walk, do a guided meditation, go do some yoga, just do something!” \n",
      "I want to see a world where all Black women, and I use that term inclusively, are well. Where we’re not burnt out, where we’re not overwhelmed, where we’re not stressed, where employers don’t undervalue our contribution — they’re not even paying us the full dollar! We’re getting what? Sixty-seven cents on the dollar? And working twice as hard to prove ourselves. That is the encapsulation of grind culture and being unwell. \n",

      "Out of the millions of fungal species in the world, only a few hundred can make people sick. Coccidioides is one of them — and it lives in desert dust. Microscopic spores are kicked up when the ground is disturbed; if inhaled, they can cause an infection known as Valley fever. Most people recover without ever knowing they had it, but others will experience far more intense symptoms, ranging from pneumonia to meningitis. Coccidioides is also really good at eating … meat. \n",
      "Fortunately, this fungus is typically only found in the southwestern US, parts of Mexico, and Central and South America — and cases are rare. But unfortunately, that range is expanding quickly. Scientists are racing to understand exactly why, because even though this fungus has existed for millennia, there are still tons of unanswered questions about how it lives both in the desert and in people.\n",

      "A \"Sold\" sign outside a home in the Toll Brothers Regency Ranch at Folsom housing community in Folsom, California, US, on Tuesday, May 16, 2023.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThis report is from today's CNBC Daily Open, our new, international markets newsletter. CNBC Daily Open brings investors up to speed on everything they need to know, no matter where they are. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.What you need to know todayStocks reboundMajor U.S. indexes rose Tuesday in a tech-fueled rally, shaking off their multiday losing streaks. However, U.S. futures dipped slightly in overnight trading. European markets traded higher too. The pan-European Stoxx 600 inched up 0.05%, breaking its six-day losing streak. That's partly thanks to a 16% surge in shares of fintech company Wise, which reported income growth of 73% year on year.Recession warningThe U.S. will slip into recession in the fourth quarter this year, and will continue languishing in it for 2024, according to HSBC Asset Management. Additionally, the euro zone will join the U.S. in seeing its economy contract next year. The silver lining of this forecast: Inflation will fall quickly, and HSBC expects the Federal Reserve to cut rates by the end of this year.Higher rates for longerEuropean Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said inflation in the euro zone is still \"too high and is set to remain so for too long.\" In May, headline inflation was 6.1% for the region, lower than April's reading of 7% but still three times the ECB's target of 2%. Lagarde warned that it's unlikely the ECB will pause rates, let alone cut them, anytime soon.Unity's A.I. marketplaceUnity shares jumped over 15% to touch $42.38 per share after the company launched a marketplace for artificial intelligence software. The company develops a game engine — also called Unity — that allows users to produce games for phones and consoles. With the new marketplace, users can choose software from other companies to generate AI graphics, text, voice and so on.[PRO] Seth Klarman on marketsLegendary investor Seth Klarman of Baupost Group spoke with CNBC Tuesday in an exclusive interview. Two highlights: Klarman pointed out one of the most common mistakes regular investors commit when buying index funds and identified a \"hunting ground\" for investors looking for opportunities. Watch the full interview here.The bottom lineRecession, recession, recession. The calls are getting so loud you'd still hear them even if you covered your ears.Here's Joseph Little, global chief strategist at HSBC Asset Management: \"\"The coming recession scenario will be more like the early 1990s recession, with our central scenario being a 1-2% drawdown in GDP.\"JPMorgan Chase's top strategist Marko Kolanovic: \"We expect a more challenging backdrop for stocks … given the decelerating economy and a likely recession starting in 4Q23/1Q24.\"Baupost Group Chief Executive Officer Seth Klarman: \"The goal of the Fed is to reduce the heat in the economy, and one way to do that is to trigger some kind of recession … so maybe it's an early 2024 event.\"Yet fresh economic data from the U.S. showed a resilient economy that, with luck, might eventually defy those predictions.Consumer confidence rose more than anticipated to hit the highest level since January 2022; the proportion of respondents expecting a recession declined four percentage points (though it's still high at 69.3%).The housing market, generally an early indicator of a downturn, also showed surprising strength. New home sales in May rose 12.2% from April — economists were expecting a drop of 1.2%. Home prices in April increased 1.3% month over month, according to the Case-Shiller index, a closely watched gauge.Demand for durable goods, which are typically big purchases like televisions and transportation equipment that require long-term payments, accelerated 1.7% in May. That's faster than April's 1.2% increase and far more than the Dow Jones estimate of a 1% decline.All those data show that the U.S. consumer isn't yet buckling under higher interest rates and (ostensibly) dimmer economic prospects.And if Wolfe Research's Chief Investment Strategist Chris Senyek's expectation for \"the U.S. consumer to be the #1 driver of the economic outlook\" proves right, then that strength in consumers might allow the U.S. economy to fend off a recession, despite a chorus of voices predicting one.\n",
