(ap photo/jose luis magana, file)the associated pressthe \" rage giving \" did not last. abortion access groups who received a windfall of donations following the supreme court's overturning of roe v. wade one year ago say those emergency grants have ended and individual and foundation giving has dropped off. after the dobbs decision, some major funders of abortion access also have ended or shifted funding from organizations working in states where abortion is now banned, said naa amissah-hammond, senior director of grantmaking with groundswell fund, which funds grassroots groups organizing for reproductive justice.women's health and foster care nonprofits, who expected increased demand in areas where access to abortion has been eliminated or restricted, say they also haven't seen increased support.holly calvasina said her experience as director of development at the reproductive health clinic choices in memphis, tennessee, might provide an explanation. like many working in the reproductive rights sector, calvasina said she tried to prepare for the increase in need, even before a draft of the supreme court decision was leaked in may last year. while some funders saw the writing on the wall and stepped up support, others wanted to wait and see. \"i think (that) really speaks to kind of a fundamental issue with philanthropy and responding to an emergent crisis,\" calvasina said. \"philanthropy moves really slowly and human rights crises unfold quickly.\" the rollercoaster of giving also showed up for choices in the $150,000 in donations to their annual spring appeal last year. that's up from $2,000 in 2021. this year, the appeal raised $40,000. organizations in states where abortion has been banned or limited have needed to pivot, said marsha jones, executive director of the afiya center, based in dallas. her organization used donations received after the dobbs decision to expand its birthing center, but she said funders are less interested in supporting maternal health than they were in supporting advocacy and practical support for abortions. she argues, as she has for years, that supporting reproductive justice is more than supporting abortion access.\"it is literally people wanting to choose full bodily autonomy,\" she said of those choosing to carry a pregnancy to term and others who do not. data on last year's charitable giving to any sector is hard to come by. the pandemic has slowed the public release of donor reports to the irs, though a delay of up to two years was typical even before covid-19 hit. donations to human services and public society benefit organizations, sectors that could include abortion access nonprofits, both declined in 2022, while donations to health organizations increased 5%, which is actually a decline when adjusted for inflation, according to the giving usa report released last week.but a special layer of opacity exists around funding for abortion access. many donors fund anonymously, sometimes requiring grantees not to publicly disclose the source. the largest historic funder, the susan thompson buffett foundation, eventually makes gifts public through tax filings, but the organization does not comment on support for abortion access and did not respond to questions about whether or how its funding strategy changed in response to the dobbs decision. another large funder, the david and lucile packard foundation, said it is shifting its grantmaking after dobbs. it stopped funding sex education programs in schools and ended funding for abortion services that closed due to new laws. the foundation also added $14.1 million in funding last year to \"shore up providers in safe haven states,\" and to help people find and access abortion care.the william and flora hewlett foundation said it provides steady support to grantees in all states to fund abortion care where it remains legal or advocacy against bans.in general, giving to organizations specifically serving women and girls represents less than 2% of all donations, according to a research project of the women's philanthropy institute at indiana university's lilly family school of philanthropy.calvasina thinks anonymous funding, especially from the largest foundations, perpetuates inequality within the movement. others in the sector said donors have many reasons for wanting to be anonymous, including to avoid being targeted by groups opposing abortion. one measure of the potential amount of funding available to reproductive health organizations is the extent of gifts from donor-advised funds hosted by the silicon valley community foundation to planned parenthood affiliates across the country. those donations exceeded $98 million in 2022, according to data from candid, a nonprofit that compiles information about charitable giving. the foundation declined to speak about the gifts, citing its policy not to comment on daf grants. seeing a drop in giving after a major event is not that unusual, said una osili, associate dean for research and international programs at the lilly family school.\"if you think about the decision to give, whether it's to a natural disaster or crisis, people hear about it and they want to participate to make a difference,\" osili said. danielle gletow, founder and executive director at one simple wish, a nonprofit connecting donors with foster children who have specific requests, said people are seeking out groups like hers offering direct support. but she worries that abortion access restrictions may further strain the foster care system. in texas, where the state's child welfare program is so overwhelmed that children sometimes sleep in office buildings, foster care workers fear the state's strict laws on abortion may force women to have children for whom they cannot care, adding to the foster children population.\"i don't think it's possible to break anything worse when it's already broken, if i'm being honest,\" gletow said. \"this is a system that's incredibly broken.\"philanthropic support has surged to states such as new mexico, which passed laws protecting access to abortion and shielding abortion providers while bordering texas and oklahoma, where abortion is now banned. a coalition of local groups publicly asked incoming funders and groups to coordinate with them as recently as february.charlene bencomo, executive director of bold futures, a leader of the coalition, said they ask new providers to accept medicaid, which can cover abortion in the state, and to offer reproductive health services outside of abortion care.\"we continue to look for a higher quality of care, a better quality of care for our folks in new mexico and for those who need to come here to access care that they cannot in their home state,\" bencomo said. amissah-hammond, of the groundswell fund, said she's waiting to see if funders who responded with emergency or one-time grants last year will continue to fund abortion access over the long term. for funders concerned about legal liabilities, she suggested they offer general operating support, rather than project-based grants, and accept updates over the phone. \"we're learning a lot from our peer funders who have been funding in global contexts,\" she said. \"where work for reproductive rights, health and justice has been criminalized for a long time and where lgbtq rights has been criminalized and work, frankly, for democracy has been criminalized.\" ___associated press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the ap's

      "Title: From ‘brain death’ to innovator, the Ukraine war has transformed NATO\n",
      "ever since president vladimir putin gave the order for russian troops to invade ukraine, the international response has understandably focused on how best to end the land war. that has meant sending conventional military hardware – tanks, missile systems, artillery – and training ukrainian soldiers.   not bad for an organization france's president emmanuel macron warned in 2019 was facing \"brain death.\" russia's aggression hasn't been restricted to the battlefield. even before the invasion, nato officials noted a rise in non-conventional warfare aimed at ukraine and other western targets. since the start of the war, disinformation, energy restrictions and cyberattacks on infrastructure have all been weaponized by the kremlin to justify and advance its war.   \"a weapon, by its broadest definition, is something that you can use to coerce someone into doing what you want them to do. you can put a gun to their head, you can blackmail them, you can spread disinformation to turn others against them or you can turn off the energy to their house,\" david van weel, nato's assistant secretary general for emerging security challenges, told cnn. those weapons are not only aimed at the target, in this case ukraine. \"russia claims that nato promised never to expand to the east after the dissolution of the soviet union. and although we've been debunking that for years, you see that this keeps coming back. and there's definitely a percentage of our population that falls for this kind of disinformation,\" van weel said.     these sorts of attacks can have very real-world impact, van weel explained, referencing a cyberattack that took out german wind farms last year. it is commonly accepted that energy security has been a key feature of the war in ukraine, with russia using energy as a weapon against western allies.   much of the western focus since the start of the war has been on defense spending. it is no secret that the vast majority of nato allies have for years fallen far short of their 2% target, something that has long infuriated officials at nato's brussels hq.  a common explanation as to why this happened is that in the post-soviet era, western countries became complacent, feeling that they had won the cold war.   \"countries far away from invasion themselves felt that distance would lead security, and they could continue to ignore the growing urgency of investment in hard security,\" said keir giles, a senior fellow at the london-based chatham house think tank.   \"spending 2% of gdp on defence was supposed to be a baseline – the minimum credible level of defence budget. over time, cynical countries who didn't feel at risk pointed to the spending of 2% to claim that they were doing enough on defense. but in reality, there was no stipulation on what that 2% – even if they reached that threshold – was spent on, so it was never an indication of how prepared or useful they might be,\" giles added.    this inertia has also held back the west's ability to deal with cyber and non-conventional threats from adversaries, including russia and china. to those working in these areas, it came as no surprise that russia had been so successful interfering in the elections of other nations or that china had so successfully spread disinformation in western countries during the pandemic.   peter caddick-adams, a former official nato historian, explains that it is extremely difficult for nations not currently at war to behave as though they are. this war mentality is key when dealing with threats that are not boots on the ground, but are just as aggressive and exist in places that are harder to see.  \"nato could only go as fast as members were willing to invest. if you are a peacetime democracy, it's very difficult to switch to that footing and counterattack your opponent's non-conventional attacks. if you are not at war, there will be a limit on what you and your public are willing to spend on things they can't see,\" he told cnn.   while all eyes will be on whether or not sweden becomes the 32nd country to join nato at its summit next month, the collective defense alliance will also use its meeting to show that it's prepared for its future.   it will announce the nato innovation fund, a project that will bring 23 of nato's members together with private business in the technology sector. it will make the participating nations limited partners, meaning they will not seek majority stakes in companies and allow the companies to carry on working with other investors, including from outside nato.   why is an organization like nato taking such a relaxed approach to developing technologies that will soon become so critical to national and international security?  \"innovation used to come from the defense sector. we think of gps and the internet. but that world has completely changed around that now. innovation comes from start-ups and academic ecosystems, not from big companies or governments anymore,\" said van weel.   the innovation fund is the second major nato plan to deal with non-conventional and emerging threats to launch this year. the defence innovation accelerator for the north atlantic (diana) launched its first pilot challenge program on june 19.    will this push to better prepare the west for whatever the next decade looks like succeed? china, after all, is becoming more hostile and there is no certainty as to how the russia's war in ukraine ends, nor if it spills beyond ukraine's borders. and if the war does end, is there a risk that allies revert to the complacency of the past?  giles argues that nato is dealing with the consequences of decades when its members \"had the luxury of pretending that the problem of defense and security had gone away.\" russia's invasion \"ought to have proven beyond any doubt that europe is under threat and needs to invest in protecting itself, both in terms of conventional and non-conventional security,\" he said.   and while politicians are promising renewed spending and attention right now, he fears that convincing the public this is essential, even after ukraine, is \"a leap of imagination that seems beyond the capabilities of most western politicians.\"  caddick-adams says that ukraine provides a window for nato to prove that the alliance can act effectively without engaging in war itself, thereby making its members more comfortable with spending in the future.   \"ukraine has become a springboard basically for nato's experiments in this non-conventional stuff. without engaging russia, nato has enabled ukraine to try some of the things nato would like to do but politically cannot do. it answers a lot of questions about warmongering or german uneasiness, but militarily in terms of capabilities,\" he said.   it's easy to forget exactly how recently macron made his \"brain death\" comments. the manner in which the alliance was caught cold by putin's escalation might lend some credibility to that view.  but the alliance's unity has been one of the least expected and most welcome aspects of the west's response to the war in ukraine. and the relative stability of the politics within the alliance has created windows for nato to try new things and get the money to do so.   however, officials are also aware that this collegiate approach might not last forever. and it's not the unknown factor of how long the war persists and countries losing interest that worries some officials the most. it's the prospect of elections happening across the alliance in which the issue of ukraine could become a wedge issue – including the small matter of the race for the white house in 2024.   \n",

      "a federal jury in new york convicted three men tuesday of stalking a new jersey family on behalf of the chinese government.  the defendants – michael mcmahon, 55; zhu yong, 66; and zheng congying, 27 – were convicted of conspiracy and stalking charges related to the plot following a three-week trial. mcmahon, a former sergeant in the new york city police department, and yong were also convicted of illegally acting as an agent of the people's republic of china.  the guilty verdicts are the first trial victory in the us department of justice's efforts to combat operation fox hunt, the chinese communist party's international alleged anti-corruption campaign targeting those the chinese government considers fugitives – often former officials or rich individuals suspected of economic crimes.  three other defendants have pleaded guilty in connection with their roles in the prc-directed harassment and intimidation campaign, according to the doj.  the chinese government launched operation fox hunt in 2014 to target wealthy citizens who were accused of corruption and had fled the country with large amounts of money.  \"the defendants engaged in a campaign of harassment and coercion on behalf of the prc to force the victim's repatriation to china from the united states, including by threatening family members,\" us assistant attorney general matthew olsen said in a statement tuesday.   \"the department of justice will hold accountable those who would help repressive regimes violate the fundamental freedoms of people in the u.s.,\" he said.  according to prosecutors, the defendants embarked on a years-long campaign targeting a former chinese government official who had lived in the us for several years. the three men threatened, harassed, surveilled and intimidated the man and his family between 2016 and 2019 to return to china, they said.  defendants left threatening note, doj says in 2015, the chinese government prompted interpol to issue an international red notice for the former chinese official and his wife, alleging they were wanted by the prc on corruption-related charges, the doj said.  prosecutors said yong hired mcmahon, who was working as a private investigator, to get information about the targeted man, his family and his daughter from government databases. mcmahon then reported back to yong and others, including a police officer with the chinese government, to give details about the family, prosecutors said.  mcmahon also surveilled the man's sister-in-law as part of the operation, which was orchestrated by prc officials.  the plot included recording the former official's daughter, taping a threatening note to the front door of his house, and flying his elderly father from china – allegedly against his will – in 2017 to pressure his son to return to china.  prosecutors said the note, which defendant zheng left at the family's new jersey home after attempting to force open the front door, stated: \"if you are willing to go back to the mainland and spend 10 years in prison, your wife and children will be all right. that's the end of this matter!\"   the us government charged eight people, including six chinese citizens, related to the plot in 2020. three other defendants previously pleaded guilty in connection with the scheme, prosecutors said.  speaking at a news conference in october 2020 after the charges were announced, then-us assistant attorney general john c. demers said the arrests sent a message that the us \"will not tolerate this type of flagrant conduct on our shores.\" \"without coordination with our government, china's repatriation squads enter the united states, surveil and locate the alleged fugitives, and deploy intimidation and other tactics to force them back into china where they would face certain imprisonment or worse following illegitimate trials,\" he said at the time. \n",

      "desperately projecting that everything is as it was, the kremlin is only emphasizing how much has changed. these were 36 hours that provided a glimpse of the end of russian president vladimir putin's rule. almost every action was improbable, at best a week ago – much was inconceivable, 17 months ago. a loyal henchman slams the premise of the invasion, then claims an airstrike targeted his troops, before taking a major military town without clashes, prigozhin said, and then marching to within a few hundred miles of moscow. but suddenly he executes a baffling reversal, turning back to avoid bloodshed, as the kremlin claims alexander lukashenko, the president of belarus whom putin seems to treat with contempt, brokered a dramatic reprieve, in which the insurrectionist who has his armor bound for moscow, now opts for exile in minsk. even as the dust settles, it still makes little sense. it is important to remember we have yet to hear from yevgeny prigozhin that he has accepted exile in belarus and see evidence his units have genuinely all stood down. he is an open proliferator of misinformation. we should be equally suspicious of the apparent bow with which kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov tried to tie this startling episode up with on saturday night. two hours earlier, wagner were at the gates of the capital (almost), and then suddenly everything is forgiven. there are large parts of this story missing. we may never learn what they are. many emotions could have altered prigozhin's course. was the advance north too easy? did he accept entering the capital would leave his men vulnerable, even to a weak russian military response? were the regular military not joining him in large enough number? did he believe a climbdown would only grow his support? while on the surface, prigozhin's climbdown makes him appear weak, even finished, he has been the decision-maker over the past 36 hours.  putin has been left reacting. silent initially, and then bombastically angry and confident, promising \"inevitable punishment\" for the \"scum.\" but hours later, this was all forgotten. putin's emotional state - were it known - is arguably less revealing than his actions. by letting prigozhin go, and apparently sweeping the entire insurrection under the carpet, he's appeared the weakest yet in 23 years.  it is possible his special services will now pursue wagner and its supporters, slowly, away from the glare of the last two days. yet the kremlin's solution to the problem was to climb down too. it's a move so antipathetic to everything putin stands for, it can only suggest he had no other choice: that he lacked the forces to be sure he could hold prigozhin back.  that is perhaps the larger lesson of the so-called march of justice. not that a mercenary boss didn't send a modest-sized force into moscow to execute a coup, but that the kremlin had to let him go.  putin's vulnerability is assured putin's position was clearly weakening because of the war's catastrophic mismanagement. but how he would be removed - what possible circumstances could permit that - was something that eluded officials and analysts. this was not a likely option.  but now it has happened, we have a glimpse behind the thickset curtain the kremlin relies upon to hide its infighting, incompetence and frailty, allowing it to project an outsized confidence – a post-soviet omnipotence. it's pretty ugly in there it seems. now the rest of the world has seen this too – from ukraine to nato to putin's allies. notably some friends were quiet: kazakhstan and iran – both of whom owe russia a past debt – called this an \"internal matter.\" that is not unqualified support.  we can only guess whether the thought of prigozhin in charge will cause such panic in the elite country houses of suburban moscow that support for putin sustains. yet his vulnerability is now assured, for the first time in 23 years – two decades in which he has accrued plentiful enemies and debts. (it is ridiculous to maintain the last two days have been an elaborate charade designed to somehow improve putin's position or provide a pretext for escalation. this is an entirely internal affair, distracting from the urgent needs of the war. making the kremlin head seem this unequivocally weak can in no way strengthen his position). so where does this leave russia and its anxious adversaries? we can't know what comes next, but it is likely to follow the explosively erratic pattern of the last two days. prigozhin may vanish for a few months. putin may make some changes in his military staff. things may seem \"normal.\" but they have absolutely changed and a post-putin world – and the dramatic force needed to impose it – has been glimpsed. it feels like the beginning of the end for him. the most acute catalyst to any change will be the impact this bizarre drama has on the ukraine frontlines. it is impossible to imagine that a series of fluctuations in russia's military presence has not weakened defensive positions in the south and east – the very places where ukraine is pushing forwards. the most optimistic assessment you could make is that russian military morale must have felt a hiccup while watching its commander-in-chief and most prominent military figure engage in a 24-hour game of chicken. would you genuinely give your life on the russian front lines this weekend, given the mess you observe in the higher command? ukraine claims to be already pushing forward. it is too early to know what impact the justice march has had on the war. but the kremlin must be acutely aware of the damage to both the positions of putin and prigozhin if this conflict – which moscow has framed as an existential battle against nato – is ultimately lost. perhaps that stark recognition was quietly feeding the bizarre decisions and reversals as wagner fighters made such easy progress on saturday north on the m4 highway to moscow. \n",

      "Title: Wagner Group shot down 6 Russian helicopters and a plane during its mini-rebellion, weakening Putin's air force at a time when it could prove critical\n",
      "wagner group forces took out six russian helicopters and another aircraft during yevgeny prigozhin's short-lived rebellion, ukrainian officials said sunday, in a development that could hand ukraine a defensive edge in the fighting.according to the kyiv independent, yurii ihnat, a ukrainian air force spokesperson, emphasized the benefit to ukraine, saying: \"mi-8 transport helicopters are powerful hardware that really helps the russian army in its war against ukraine.\"reports differ on the exact specifications of the destroyed aircraft. ihnat has said that wagner took out two attack helicopters and four transport aircraft, while pro-kremlin military bloggers were cited by the kyiv independent as saying three of them were electronic-warfare helicopters. the open-source weapons tracker site oryx, whose helicopter tally matches that of the cited military bloggers, said it had documented evidence of the following russian losses: a mi-35 attack helicopter, a ka-52 attack helicopter, three mi-8 electronic-warfare helicopters, one mi-8 transport, and an il-22m airborne command post.it added that prigozhin had captured a russian mrap patrol vehicle and a tigr-m infantry mobility vehicle. oryx said that prigozhin had lost two trucks, two technical vehicles, and an infantry mobility vehicle to the russian army proper. after an astonishing 36 hours, which saw prigozhin direct his militia into action on russian soil and then make a rush toward moscow, russian leadership and the paramilitary boss reached a wary agreement in which prigozhin was exiled to belarus.hanna malyar, ukraine's deputy defense minister, told the associated press: \"the enemy's weakness is always a window of opportunity. it allows us to take the advantage.\"it's too soon to see how the chaos between wagner and the russian military establishment will affect things on the ground, she said.on sunday, as the wagner debacle unfolded in russia, ukrainian soldiers near bakhmut told agence france-presse that it did not appear to have affected the situation there.\"as it attacked yesterday, russia continued to attack today,\" a soldier identified only as nazar told the outlet. nonetheless, the loss of six helicopters in a single weekend is significant.in one year of defending against russia, ukraine had shot down about 30 of russia's helicopters, forbes reported in february. at that time, russia had about 300 helicopters — around half of them attack helicopters — based near its western borders, the kyiv post reported.as the recent chaos unfolded in russia, ukraine said it had managed to push forward in its counteroffensive. as of early monday local time, ukraine's military said it had advanced half a mile around the ukrainian city of bakhmut, the guardian reported. nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said monday that prigozhin's rebellion was evidence putin had made a \"big strategic mistake\" in invading ukraine last year, the outlet added. \n",

      "Title: Wagner leader Prigozhin will move to Belarus following the mercenary group's uprising against Putin, Kremlin spokesman says\n",
      "the kremlin has forged a deal with wagner group boss yevgeny prigozhin to defuse the mercenary group's uprising on saturday.in exchange for prigozhin's exile to belarus, the mercenary leader won't be prosecuted, the associated press reported, citing a kremlin spokesperson.the reported agreement comes after a paramilitary rebellion on saturday in which the wagner group marched across russia before suddenly turning around just 120 miles from moscow. prigozhin said he didn't want to shed russian blood.kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov announced saturday that prigozhin — and the troops who follow him — will not face criminal prosecution as part of the deal. he also said those troops who did not join in the uprising would be offered defense ministry contracts. saturday's rebellion marked the strongest threat to president vladimir putin's power in over 20 years. prigozhin had dubbed his procession towards moscow a \"march for justice,\" and made baseless claims that russia's defense minister had ordered an air strike on the wagner group on friday and killed large numbers of troops. the kremlin denied the allegation.earlier on saturday, prigozhin posted a voice note to his telegram channel, calling his 25,000 troops \"patriots\" and defending their cause. \"we don't want the country to continue to live any longer in corruption, deceit, and bureaucracy,\" prigozhin said, according to a reuters translation.belarus president aleksandr lukashenko, a close putin ally who has also long known prigozhin, spent all day saturday negotiating with prigozhin, according to the new york times. prigozhin was once, himself, a close putin ally, but tensions have grown high since russia's invasion of ukraine in 2022. prigozhin evenly openly criticized russia's invasion of ukraine as a \"racket\" in a public statement last week, the times reported. though he didn't directly criticize putin, he publicly refuted russia's justification for the invasion. \"the war wasn't needed to return russian citizens to our bosom, nor to demilitarize or denazify ukraine,\" prigozhin said. \"the war was needed so that a bunch of animals could simply exult in glory.\"the wagner group's rebellion first began friday. by the next day, putin had formally accused prigozhin of treason and issued a warrant for his arrest.moscow had been bracing for violence, with residents fleeing, city officials warning people to stay home, and workers destroying highways leading into the city.by saturday, the wagner group had apparently gained control of military headquarters in rostov-on-don, a city 660 miles south of moscow where russia's operations in ukraine are managed, according to the associated press. on saturday, the mercenary group was reportedly also in lipesk province, just 225 miles south of moscow. \n",

      "Title: An epic fight over how real-estate agents get paid could transform the housing market forever\n",
      "let's say you're ready to sell your house. trying to find a buyer and sifting through offers sounds like a nightmare, so you hire a real-estate agent. in exchange for their guidance, you agree to pay the agent 3% of the sale price, which they say is industry standard. your agent advises you that in order to drum up sufficient interest in your home, you should also promise to cover the commission for the buyer's agent — another 3% of the sale price. this seems like a hefty chunk of change, but you go along with the setup since you almost certainly couldn't navigate the transaction without some professional help. you get some glossy photos taken, hang a sign in your front yard, and wait for the offers to pour in. when the deal closes, however, you don't cut a check to both agents. instead you give 6% of your proceeds to your agent, who then splits that with the buyer's broker.as the money makes its way to all the players in the transaction, you may wonder: why does it work this way? according to the plaintiffs of two massive class-action lawsuits, this circuitous method of paying real-estate agents is all part of a far-reaching scheme that is bilking home sellers out of billions of dollars every year. the heart of the problem, according to the lawsuits, are the multiple listing services — local, online databases where agents share photos and detailed information about homes for sale. the mlss are a central component of the us real-estate market, and the most critical tools that licensed agents have at their disposal — in fact, they're one of the most persuasive reasons for even hiring an agent in the first place. in order to access an mls, listing agents must agree that money from the sale will follow the prescribed, serpentine path. but now two multibillion-dollar lawsuits — sitzer et al. v. nar et al. and moehrl et al. v. nar et al. — threaten to upend the entire system. the plaintiffs, representing a large swath of home sellers around the country, are accusing the national association of realtors and some of the country's largest brokerages of using mls rules to charge exorbitant fees and unfairly prop up agent commissions. these lawsuits are finally coming to a head after simmering for several years, and if the plaintiffs succeed, they could rewrite the rules of how agents get paid. the seller might no longer pay out both agents' commissions after the sale closes. instead, a buyer would pay their agent directly. proponents say these changes would increase competition among agents, dramatically lower commissions, and potentially save consumers as much as $20 billion to $30 billion a year. the defendants, led by the nar, argue that the current setup actually favors consumers by providing broad access to an efficient real-estate market. despite the potentially earthshaking consequences, most local real-estate agents — who, to be fair, have more pressing short-term concerns — have largely ignored the cases. but if the plaintiffs prevail, these cases could radically reshape what buying and selling a home looks like, and they represent the biggest existential threat to the real-estate industry today.when you buy a home with the help of a real-estate agent, paying for their services will probably be among the least of your worries — and agents are happy to have it that way. the rules are designed to make their commissions as inconspicuous as possible: since the seller pays both agents, the buyer doesn't pay anything up front. until just a few years ago, realtors were even allowed to tell buyers that their services were free. of course, that's not really the case. the buyer is the one coming up with the money for the property, after all. but the illusion helps agents preserve their commissions, the plaintiffs argue, since buyers don't have to think about the fees, and sellers are incentivized to promise high commissions in order to get brokers to look favorably upon their properties. the nar argues that this is the most efficient arrangement. buyers don't have to pay out of pocket for their agent, and sellers benefit from closing the deal without delays over which agent gets paid what. but detractors, including the plaintiffs in the two lawsuits, say this setup forces sellers to pay inflated commissions to buyers' agents in order to generate interest in their homes. and they say the defendants in the case — the nar along with large brokerages like re/max, keller williams, anywhere real estate (formerly realogy), and homeservices of america — have benefited from this shell game. ultimately, the rules of the mls are the sticking points. what agents collectively refer to as the mls is actually a web of roughly 600 independent, local databases around the country. nearly 97% of these mlss are owned or operated by local realtor associations, according to court filings, and are governed by rules mandated by the nar. the reach of the mls is incredibly powerful — nearly 86% of sellers last year listed their properties on the databases, according to the nar. in exchange for this access, the nar requires sellers who list on an mls to agree to the \"cooperative compensation rule\" — the expectation that the seller will pay a commission to the buyer's agent.the rule is the primary target of the two class-action lawsuits, both of which are seeking billions of dollars in damages. sellers, the plaintiffs argue, had no choice but to list their homes on an mls. this, in turn, meant they were forced to agree to the rules of the databases — including paying exorbitant commissions to buyers' agents who might choose to pass over their properties if they didn't. the first case to reach trial will be sitzer et al. v. nar et al., which was filed in missouri and is scheduled for an october trial. total damages in the case could reach nearly $4 billion. in the larger of the two cases, moehrl et al. v. nar et al., damages could total more than $40 billion. that case, which was filed in illinois, would likely reach a trial in the first half of 2024. brokerages named in the suits either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.stephen brobeck, a senior fellow at the consumer federation of america, told me that one of the biggest problems identified in the cases is what's known as \"steering.\" since agents representing buyers can see the promised commission for each home in the mls, they can discourage their clients from viewing properties with unsatisfactory paydays. the nar doesn't set a minimum commission that listing brokers need to promise to their counterparts on the buyer's side — technically, it could be as little as $1. but the going rate is typically between 2.5% and 3% of the total sale price, so anything below that amount means the sellers' home could be less likely to get traction. \"they not only have to pay a buyer's agent commission, but they can't negotiate that commission,\" brobeck said of sellers. \"because if they lower that commission, research has shown that the house is less likely to be shown by the buyer-agents.\" one study found that properties listed with sub-2.5% commission rates were 5% less likely to sell and took 12% longer to sell.while the plaintiffs in these cases take aim at other rules that they say hinder negotiations over compensation, their primary goal is to \"decouple\" the commissions paid to the buyer's agent and the seller's agent. if each party just pays for their own agent directly, the theory goes, there will be more transparency and more incentives for clients to negotiate with their brokers. \"it just doesn't make any sense for the seller to have to pay the buyer's agent,\" brobeck told me.katie johnson, the chief legal officer for the nar, told me the current model benefits both buyers and sellers by encouraging cooperation between agents.\"making an offer of compensation is good for the seller, because that is their listing broker making an offer to all the other professionals in the area to go to work, put your time and effort in finding this buyer, because you'll get paid for the work,\" johnson told me. \"i think that's pretty intuitive.\" buyers, meanwhile, \"benefit tremendously\" because they don't have to pay out of pocket for those expenses, johnson said.  the nar and its predecessors have periodically faced legal challenges over industry practices that critics say discourage competition and lead to inflated broker commissions. while the internet has broadened access to real-estate listings and the competition among agents has intensified over the past two decades, commission rates have remained stubbornly high relative to countries with comparable housing markets such as australia, the netherlands, and the united kingdom. nicholas economides, a professor of economics at new york university and an expert witness for the plaintiffs in the moehrl case, found that in those three markets, only about 5% to 20% of homebuyers used agents compared to 87% in the us. the buyers who did use agents typically paid 1% to 2% in commissions, compared to the 2% to 3% that's common here. sellers, meanwhile, paid 1% to 3%, compared to the 2% to 3% in the us. there have been other legal challenges to the current commission arrangement, including an antitrust investigation against the nar by the trump administration that led to a settlement — but the system so far has remained largely intact. \"we will continue to fight these cases because the model that we are currently working with,  first of all, has improved, iterated, and innovated over the last 50 years,\" johnson said. \"it will continue to innovate. but it has always been lawful and serves the best interests of consumers.\"depending on whom you ask, the pending lawsuits could either revolutionize or ruin the real-estate industry. but despite the billions of dollars at stake, the legal fights have mostly amounted to background noise — at least so far.\"everyone's not really paying that much attention,\" rob hahn, a longtime consultant to local mlss and realtor associations, told me. \"i think agents and brokers just figure, 'we'll solve this somehow.'\"that may end up being true, but the stakes for every person in the real-estate industry are incredibly high. the sheer size of the damages sought by the plaintiffs would undoubtedly wreak havoc on the industry's largest players. but for regular agents, there would also be a reckoning. if buyers have to pay out of pocket for their agents, many might choose to not hire an agent at all, or just pay an agent by the hour for their insight. agents would face more competition for clients and potentially depressed commissions. the current glut of agents would become more glaring, and a mass exodus from the industry could ensue. the nar argues that this would be a calamity for first-time and low-income buyers who don't have the cash on hand to pay an agent upfront, and would therefore risk being deprived of that expertise. brobeck, of the cfa, told me he believes the industry would be highly incentivized to find ways to allow buyers to obtain financing for their broker's fees, the way they already finance their home. in some cases, sellers could still agree to pay the buyer-agent's commissions. and because of the increased attention on commissions, both buyers and sellers would be more likely to negotiate those costs down, brobeck said.  \"i think the most successful, experienced, and competent agents will continue to be able to charge what they're charging now,\" brobeck told me. \"but the many agents who are inexperienced, less competent, less successful, will not be able to charge the going rate.\"if the typical total commissions for a real-estate sale were to fall to between 3% and 4%, instead of the customary 5% to 6% today, brobeck estimates the potential savings for consumers could reach $20 billion to $30 billion a year.but a victory for the plaintiffs is far from guaranteed, some experts say. since the nar doesn't mandate that brokers representing the seller promise a specific amount to their buyer-agent counterparts, the plaintiffs will have to prove that requiring any compensation at all hurts sellers, david eisenstadt, a managing director at berkeley research group and a former senior economist at the justice department's antitrust division, told me. the defendants could then argue something like this: if a seller is able to offer a commission of as little as $1, that's basically the same as offering zero dollars, so that requirement really isn't that onerous at all. the defense could also argue that sellers should pay the buyer-agent's commission because they actually benefit the most from their service, eisenstadt said — namely, bringing forth a buyer who's willing to shell out hundreds of thousands of dollars for their home. \"there are really strong efficiency reasons for sellers to pay the buyer-broker commission at settlement, rather than the buyer,\" eisenstadt said. on the other hand, hahn, who now runs a startup focused on bringing the auction model to residential real estate, told me he's doubtful of nar's chances of winning in court and believes some kind of settlement is likely. with the smaller of the two suits slated for trial in just a few months, the industry has little time to come to grips with what the future could hold. \"this is a real, serious threat,\" hahn said. \"this is not a joke.\"james rodriguez is a senior

      "tesla ceo elon musk has dropped the prices of tesla models six times since the start of the year, kicking off tesla price wars with mainstream car brands like ford and gm. here's a look at where the pricing stands for each of the models. the tesla model 3 is the cheapest model. the starting price for the tesla model 3 is around $40,240 for the real wheel drive, $47,240 for the long range variant, and $53,240 for the performance variant.the next cheapest model is the tesla model y. the starting price for the tesla model y is around $47,490 for the all wheel drive and $54,490 for the performance model. in early 2023, extensive tesla markdowns on the prices of the model 3 and model y hit the market, making some cost less than the average new car in the us. tesla model s and the model x are the most expensive models. the tesla model s is around $88,490 for the long range variant and $108,490 for the plaid variant.the starting price for the tesla model x: the starting price for the tesla model x is around $98,490 and $108,490 for the plaid variant.the tesla roaster is expected to be the most expensive model when it enters production, at a base price of around $200,000. as part of the 2023 inflation reduction act, some tesla models are eligible for a $7,500 ev tax credit, while others can receive a smaller credit of $3,750. as of june, three model y variants were eligible for full credit while only the performance version of the model 3 can receive the full $7,500 credit. the two other model 3 versions are eligible for half credit. a big concern for prospective ev buyers is if the battery will need replacing. ev battery replacements could cost anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000, according to recurrent.in tesla's 2021 impact report, it said that the company's battery packs are designed to outlast the vehicle. \"we estimate that a vehicle gets scrapped after approximately 200,000 miles of usage in the u.s. and roughly 150,000 miles in europe,\" the report said. tesla's batteries are also covered by a warranty. models have slightly different warranties, but they're generally covered for 8 years or between 100,000-150,000 miles (whatever comes first). while evs as a category do have more frequent problems than other vehicles such as issues with battery packs and charging, tesla models stand out for their reliability. no, tesla charging isn't free, and the cost varies based on if you charge at home or at one of tesla's proprietary superchargers. at a supercharger, charging costs vary based on the speed across four tiers and are based on time — not range or energy added to your vehicle. charges will also change based on electricity costs. on average, a tesla will charge for about 4.5 cents per mile, according to energysage estimates, depending on local electricity costs. a full charge on a level-2 charger will run you about $15.52 on average, the site says, though costs vary for each model. the cost of charging a tesla is more than 3 times cheaper per mile than the cost of fueling a gas-powered car.energysage estimates that it costs $614.95 to charge your tesla per year. in comparison, gas-powered cars cost an average of $1,850.42 to fuel per year.tesla superchargers also charge an \"idle fee\" if a car remains plugged in after it is fully charged, in order to serve more customers efficiently. some tesla vehicles also include free charging, which is sometimes added as an incentive when purchasing. free charging is also available through tesla's referral program. to get the cheapest charging, you'll need to charge at home. if you already have a 240-volt outlet in your garage (equivalent to level 2), you can simply buy a charger and plug it in. otherwise, an electrician will likely need to install one for you. here's what to know about charging teslas at home. \n",

      "the blackouts have been so severe that south africa has reduced its carbon emissions to such a level that it is one of the world's few countries to be exceeding onerous, climate-change-related emissions reduction goals.\n",
      "the anc has offered few solutions for the ongoing power crisis, which disproportionately affects poor south africans as the wealthy have begun depending on private generators. the pivot to china arrives in the context of many other african nations also welcoming chinese investment to the continent, often with disastrous results.\n",

      "under the chinese belt and road initiative (bri), the communist party has taken up infrastructure projects in ethiopia, kenya, rwanda, tanzania, zimbabwe, and many other african nations. the presence of chinese officials and business leaders has led to mounting reports of racism against locals, including cases of chinese businessmen whipping rwandan laborers, gang-beating kenyan engineers, and forcing malawian children to film racist videos for the amusement of chinese social media users in which they refer to themselves unknowingly, in mandarin, as \"black monsters.\"\n",

      "Title: Supreme Court’s surprise Voting Rights Act ruling could lead to a fairer map in Louisiana\n",
      "we just saw the latest impact from the supreme court's recent surprise ruling on the voting rights act — the surprise being that the court sided with voting rights in that alabama case. after that june 8 ruling in allen v. milligan, the court on monday dismissed a similar voting rights act appeal from louisiana — with the upshot being that a fairer congressional map may be used in louisiana ahead of the 2024 elections. more broadly, the milligan case puts democrats in a better position to win the house of representatives. in milligan, a bare majority of the supreme court upheld a crucial part of the voting rights act, the landmark civil rights law that the court had previously gutted another part of in shelby county v. holder. given the court's opposition to voting rights over the years, including in shelby county, a similar ruling was expected in the alabama case.  but in a 5-4 vote, the court said the alabama map in question diluted black voting power. the ruling paved the way for fairer maps not only in alabama but in other states, such as louisiana — specifically, it carved a path for adding a second \"majority-minority\" district, creating the possibility of more equal representation relative to the state's population.  to be sure, the supreme court already did damage on this front, by allowing these apparently illegal maps in the 2022 midterms, in which republicans barely won the house, before its surprise ruling in milligan. and further litigation will proceed in the louisiana case at the 5th u.s. circuit court of appeals, the most right-wing appeals court in the country. so we will see how the 5th circuit handles the case going forward. but with milligan as precedent, it will be more difficult for right-wing courts to dismantle voting rights. subscribe to the deadline: legal blog newsletter for weekly updates on the top legal stories, including news from the supreme court, the donald trump investigations and more. \n",

      "Title: Lawsuit against ChatGPT creator shows the creepiness of AI\n",
      "this was bound to happen.  openai, the tech company responsible for developing the artificial intelligence chatbot known as chatgpt, is being sued over its practice of scraping other people's information from the internet in order to provide users of the tool with seemingly human responses.  microsoft, a major investor in openai, is also named as a defendant. openai and microsoft do not appear to have publicly commented on the lawsuit. the class-action lawsuit strikes at the heart of generative ai tools that appear to create content from \"scratch,\" like chatgpt. in reality, such chatbots are built to scour the internet (including social media platforms) to inform their responses.  for those who aren't techies, think of chatbots like a super-powered internet search. while you historically would type in a term and then receive a list of links, chatbot responses rapidly search the internet for content that's already been created, as well as other information that may exist on the web, and synthesize the findings into a human-sounding response.  the lawsuit claims openai engages in theft when its technology does this: (note: openai isn't the only company creating generative ai tools, though it's arguably the most popular. hence the \"arms race\" line in the quote above.) the lawsuit accuses openai of scraping data belonging to millions of users, including online conversations, location data and other personal information that the company is able to obtain through third-party applications. the suit lists spotify, stripe, slack, snapchat, microsoft teams and the health app mychart as some of the third parties that allow openai access to user data. openai secretly harvests \"massive amounts of personal data from the internet,\" the suit claims, \"including private information and private conversations, medical data, information about children—essentially every piece of data exchanged on the internet it could take—without notice to the owners or users of such data, much less with anyone's permission.\" the lawsuit doesn't list the plaintiffs' names beyond initials — in order to \"avoid intrusive scrutiny as well as any potentially dangerous backlash\" — but it does offer details about their claims. some of the plaintiffs say they're worried that their online content could be used to help replace human workers with robots. for example, the lawsuit says one educator is \"concerned that defendants have taken her skills and expertise, as reflected in her online contributions, and incorporated it into products that could someday result in professional obsolescence for professors and educators like her.\"  the suit also claims that without \"this unprecedented theft of private and copyrighted information belonging to real people, communicated to unique communities, for specific purposes, targeting specific audiences, the products would not be the multi-billion-dollar business they are today.\" it's no overstatement to say this lawsuit could slow — if not completely alter — the fast-moving world of generative ai. visual artists whose works have been scraped by ai tools have already filed at least one class-action suit of their own, claiming this amounts to copyright infringement. several musicians have spoken out against the use of generative ai in their industry as well. but professional artists and creators clearly aren't the only ones with skin in the game here, as the latest lawsuit suggests. everyone who uses the internet should be invested in making sure our data isn't being used — to great profit and potential peril — by some of the most powerful tech companies in the world.  \n",

      "Title: Supreme Court strikes down Biden student loan relief plan\n",
      "the supreme court on friday struck down the biden administration's student loan forgiveness plan that would have canceled billions of dollars of debt for millions of americans. chief justice john roberts wrote the 6-3 decision, claiming the federal government lacked authority for the plan. but as justice elena kagan pointed out in her dissent, it was the majority, not the government, that overreached here. \"in every respect, the court today exceeds its proper, limited role in our nation's governance,\" she wrote, joined by her fellow democratic appointees, justices sonia sotomayor and ketanji brown jackson. apparently anticipating this outcome, the white house on friday signaled \"new actions\" coming to protect student loan borrowers. in announcing the plan last august, the white house aimed to reduce \"a significant burden on america's middle class\" by easing the \"crushing\" effects of student loans. the plan applied to people whose annual income was less than $125,000 ($250,000 for households) in either 2020 or 2021, providing up to $10,000 for most borrowers and up to $20,000 for pell grant recipients with greater financial need.  during oral arguments in february, the republican appointees were skeptical of the government's power to forgive that much debt. the court's democratic appointees were skeptical that the challengers — republican-led states and individual borrowers — even had legal standing to challenge debt relief in the first place. jackson at the time noted that the court would break new ground by finding standing here.  (in a related case on friday, department of education v. brown, involving individual borrowers, the court unanimously agreed the challengers didn't have legal standing to bring the claim. but the plan was struck down by the decision roberts authored, involving the states' challenge, biden v. nebraska.) the law at issue is the 2003 heroes act. it lets the secretary of education \"waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision\" to protect borrowers affected by national emergencies, among other things. the biden administration pointed to the covid-19 pandemic as the emergency allowing debt forgiveness.  the administration wrote to the justices ahead of the arguments that \"the acute public-health emergency caused by covid-19 is abating\" but \"the heroes act and the secretary's plan are not aimed at stopping the spread of disease; they are concerned with economic consequences.\" but the court majority's complaint, essentially, was that the government went too big.  \"the secretary has never previously claimed powers of this magnitude under the heroes act,\" roberts wrote, with seeming amazement at how different circumstances call for different responses, adding that \"past waivers and modifications issued under the act have been extremely modest and narrow in scope.\"  obviously, though, covid-19 didn't happen before it happened. pointing out this plain fact, kagan observed, \"past actions were more modest because the precipitating emergencies were more modest.\" she faulted the majority for deciding \"that some 40 million americans will not receive the benefits the plan provides, because (so says the court) that assistance is too 'significan[t].'\" and the court shouldn't have found standing in this case either, kagan argued. \"the court's first overreach in this case is deciding it at all,\" she wrote. she called the states \"classic ideological plaintiffs: they think the plan a very bad idea, but they are no worse off because the secretary differs.\"  \"a court acting like a court,\" kagan wrote, would have tossed the case on standing grounds.  her critique was apparently too much for the victors to handle, as roberts felt the need to chastise it as he closed his opinion. \"it has become a disturbing feature of some recent opinions to criticize the decisions with which they disagree as going beyond the proper role of the judiciary,\" the chief justice wrote, tone-policing the losing side of the dispute.  \"we do not mistake this plainly heartfelt disagreement for disparagement,\" roberts assured the nation, adding that it's \"important that the public not be misled either. any such misperception would be harmful to this institution and our country.\" but who cares if the justices are disparaging one another? the harm to the institution is coming from court actions like friday's rulings, not by the justices using strong language in their opinions. thus, keeping in line with his ruling's reasoning, roberts ended the opinion, and the term, by going beyond his proper role. read the full text of the opinion striking down biden's student loan forgiveness plan below. subscribe to the deadline: legal blog newsletter for weekly updates on the top legal stories, including news from the supreme court, the donald trump investigations and more. \n",

      "Title: McCarthy finds new ways to tell far-right flank what it wants to hear\n",
      "the very idea of congress un-impeaching someone seems laughable. that doesn't mean house republicans won't try to do it anyway. as we discussed last week, two prominent gop members — house republican conference chair elise stefanik of new york and georgia's marjorie taylor greene — unveiled a pair of measures to \"expunge\" both of donald trump's impeachments. (greene's resolution would effectively cancel the former president's 2019 impeachment, while stefanik's measure would undo his 2021 impeachment. both republicans are co-sponsoring each other's bills.) to be sure, ridiculous measures such as these are introduced all the time, and they're fairly easy to ignore because they stand little chance of advancing. but as the associated press reported, the \"expunge\" scheme picked up a powerful endorsement the day after it began in earnest. \"i think it is appropriate,\" the house speaker told reporters. \"just as i thought before — that you should expunge it, because it never should have gone through.\" to briefly recap for those just joining us, it was in early 2020, just two days after his first senate impeachment trial wrapped up, when trump first broached the subject of invalidating what had happened to him. \"should they expunge the impeachment in the house?\" trump asked during a brief q&a with reporters. \"they should because it was a hoax.\" a handful of gop members pushed the idea in the last congress, though the efforts were ignored — there was a democratic majority in the house at the time — but as the current congress got underway, mccarthy said he was willing to take a look at the idea. evidently, the house speaker is done looking, and he's ready to throw his support behind the gambit. (as for how such an unprecedented procedure would work, my msnbc colleague hayes brown wrote a terrific piece on this that ran this morning.) what's more, this isn't the only step mccarthy is willing to take to make his far-right flank happy. punchbowl news reported: as part of the push, the house speaker has effectively directed house judiciary committee chairman jim jordan to bring david weiss, the trump-appointed u.s. attorney who investigated hunter biden, before the panel. as for what far-right house republicans might consider \"satisfactory answers,\" it's hardly outlandish to wonder if there's anything that could fully satisfy gop members desperate to impeach someone for something. what's less clear is what's driving mccarthy's latest declarations. in the recent past, the california republican was opposed to impeachment crusades and didn't seem at all interested in pursing a trump-based legislative agenda. now, the house speaker has raised the prospect of impeaching multiple cabinet secretaries, and he's on board with trying to un-impeach the former president. we've never received a full and detailed list of the private side deals mccarthy struck in january to get his speaker's gavel, or the more recent agreements he reached after the house freedom caucus seized control of the house floor. it's hard not to wonder: is mccarthy backing outlandish ideas because he genuinely believes they're worthwhile, or is he still repaying debts to his more radical members? \n",

      "Title: Prosecutions of ‘Cop City’ protesters in Georgia take ominous turn\n",
      "there's been a shake-up in the prosecution of protesters who have demonstrated against plans for a massive new police compound in atlanta that critics have dubbed \"cop city.\" and the news is raising questions about politicized law enforcement in georgia.  more than 40 people are facing domestic terrorism charges in connection with protests in recent months, according to the associated press. on friday, the district attorney of dekalb county, sherry boston, announced that she'll no longer take part in their prosecutions, which will now be overseen by georgia's republican attorney general, chris carr. the statement from the dekalb da's office said: the announcement followed a report from the intercept last week that the georgia ag had denied boston's request to drop domestic terrorism charges against a southern poverty law center legal observer who was arrested at the construction site in march. critics of \"cop city,\" including many faith leaders, oppose the 85-acre facility because it requires destroying part of a forest and they worry that it would contribute to overpolicing in dekalb, a majority-black county. one protester, known as tortuguita, was fatally shot by police in january. the dekalb district attorney's withdrawal from the prosecutions was celebrated by activists. in a statement, the naacp legal defense fund's associate director-counsel, tona boyd, called it a \"welcome development\" but added that it \"also deepens our serious concern about whether these arrests have been motivated by something other than an impartial and objective evaluation of the evidence or a just exercise of prosecutorial discretion.\" indeed, this development is colored by troubling events at the state level. in recent months, georgia republicans have taken steps to usurp power from liberal district attorneys and circumvent their wishes. these moves, including legislation that makes it easier to oust das from their posts, are part of an effort to cast liberal das as soft on crime. as the naacp ldf said, it's good news that the dekalb da is no longer engaging in this tough-on-crime charade when it comes to the \"cop city\" cases. but the republican ag still will be — and that's deeply concerning.  \n",

(we all know the hassle of online returns, right?) instead i bought this shoe stretch spray on a whim. i didn't expect much but wow! the shoes that took me a minute of struggling to get into fit *perfectly* now!! the process was as simple as could be, too. i just sprayed my shoes (inside and out, heel to toe) like there was no tomorrow, i put on some semi-thick socks (just to ensure i had ample room later), and wore the shoes around my house for about 30–40 minutes. as i was walking around, i could literally feel them begin to loosen up. after about 30 minutes, i took my shoes and thick socks off, and the shoes just ~slide~ on. easy peasy. now i have a new favorite pair of shoes and zero dollars have been wasted. i tried these with a pair of chunky leather loafers, but i can only imagine what they'll do for my pair of dr. martens — the boots known to take a while to break into. this stuff is a must!\" get it from amazon for $9.99. \n",

      "Author(s): Chris van Tulleken\n",
      "Title: It’s Time to End the Tyranny of Ultra-Processed Food\n",
      "this type of food is usually wrapped in plastic and has additives that you won't find in a typical kitchen. in the us and the uk, we get on average 60 percent of our calories from upf products like pizza, bread, breakfast cereals, biscuits, and nutritional drinks. they're often sold as healthy options, but it's just a way of turning our ill health into money. upf is a byproduct of a complicated financial system that involves repurposing waste from animal food into human food.\n",
      "to solve this problem, the first thing we need to do is include in the official uk guidance about nutrition the information that ultra-processed foods are associated with weight gain and diet-related diseases, and that the recommendation for people is to avoid these foods. many countries like brazil and france already do this.\n",
      "limiting the marketing of ultra-processed foods is essential. we need to learn the lessons from regulating the tobacco industry and stop predatory companies selling this food to people.\n",
      "we also need to change the ultra-processed institutional food that we serve in hospitals, schools, and prisons. there is very good evidence that when feeding patients and staff in hospitals, real food is hugely beneficial.\n",
      "there are also misconceptions we need to address. for instance, people who live with diet-related diseases, especially obesity, usually have a strong feeling of guilt, thinking they are the problem due to their own lack of willpower. researchers now know this isn't true. this food has been engineered to be addictive. we need to shift the blame away from the population.\n",
      "normally, we would blame the food companies and demand change from them. but when you speak to people in any of those companies it's very clear that they are unable to change. danone is the best example of this. its previous ceo, emmanuel faber, tried to turn the company into a social enterprise by stopping the sale of ultra-processed food and increasing the environmental portfolio. the share price tanked, activist investors threw him out, and danone had no option but to go back to its previous business model. all the big transnational food corporations are answerable to their owners. if we don't understand this financial loop, we will keep shouting at companies that cannot change their business model. what we have to understand is that the responsibility lies with governments. they need a mandate from their population to change the regulations.\n",
      "another group of people whom we don't criticize enough are the doctors, who have a very long history of partnering with transnational food corporations and supplement providers to mislead people. most nutrition research is funded by the food industry and that's clearly wrong.\n",
      "anyone who's struggling with this as an individual should take their guilt and shame and transfer it outwardly to the corporations that are feeding us these addictive substances, to the governments doing nothing about it, and to the physicians and the social media personalities who keep telling us that this stuff is healthy. we need to end the conflict of interest between the industry and politicians, doctors and scientists. only then can we really tackle the problem.\n",

      "Author(s): Maryn McKenna\n",
      "Title: States With Abortion Bans Are Losing a Generation of Ob-Gyns\n",
      "fishbach was in michigan, where an abortion ban enacted in 1931 instantly came into effect. that law made administering an abortion a felony punishable by four years in prison, with no exceptions for rape or incest. it was a chilling moment: her residency is in obstetrics and gynecology, and she viewed mastering abortion procedures as essential to her training.\n",
      "\"i suspected during my application cycle that this could happen, and to receive confirmation of it was devastating,\" she recalls. \"but i had strategically applied where i thought that, even if i didn't receive the full spectrum, i would at least have the support and the resources to get myself to an institution that would train me.\"\n",
      "her mind whirled through the possibilities. would her program help its residents go to an access-protecting state? could she broker an agreement to go somewhere on her own, arranging weeks of extra housing and obtaining a local medical license and insurance? would she still earn her salary if she left her program—and how would she fund her life if she did not?\n",
      "in the end, she didn't need to leave. that november, michigan voters approved an amendment to the state constitution that made the 1931 law unenforceable, and this april, governor gretchen whitmer repealed the ban. fishbach didn't have to abandon the state to learn the full range of ob-gyn care. in fact, her program at the university of michigan, where she's now a second-year resident, pivoted to making room for red-state trainees.\n",
      "but the dizzying reassessment she underwent a year ago provides a glimpse of the challenges that face thousands of new and potential doctors. almost 45 percent of the 286 accredited ob-gyn programs in the us now operate under revived or new abortion bans, meaning that more than 2,000 residents per year—trainee doctors who have committed to the specialty—may not receive the required training to be licensed. among students and residents, simmering anger over bans is growing. long-time faculty fear the result will be a permanent reshaping of american medicine, driving new doctors from red states to escape limitations and legal threats, or to protect their own reproductive options. that would reduce the number of physicians available, not just to provide abortions, but to conduct genetic screenings, care for miscarriages, deliver babies, and handle unpredictable pregnancy risks.\n",
      "\"i worry that we're going to see an increase in maternal morbidity, differentially, depending on where you live,\" says kate shaw, a physician and associate chair of ob-gyn education at stanford medicine. \"and that's just going to further enhance disparities that already exist.\"\n",
      "those effects are not yet visible. the pipeline that ushers medical graduates through physician training is about a decade long: four years of school plus three to seven years of residency, sometimes with a two-year, sub-specialty fellowship afterward. thus actions taken in response to the dobbs decision—people eschewing red-state schools or choosing to settle in blue states long-term—might take a while to be noticeable.\n",
      "but in this year, some data has emerged that suggests trends to come. in february, a group of students, residents and faculty surveyed 2,063 licensed and trainee physicians and found that 82 percent want to work or train in states that retain abortion access—and 76 percent would refuse to apply in states that restrict it. (the respondents worked in a mix of specialties; for those whose work would include performing abortions, the proportion intending to work where it remains legal soared above 99 percent.)\n",
      "then in april, a study from the association of american medical colleges drawing on the first round of applications to residency programs after dobbs found that ob-gyn applications in states with abortion restrictions sank by 10 percent compared to the previous year. applications to all ob-gyn programs dropped by 5 percent. (nationwide, all applications to residency went down 2 percent from 2021 to 2022.)\n",
      "last month, two preliminary pieces of research presented at the annual meeting of the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists uncovered more perturbations. in texas—where the restrictive law sb8 went into effect in september 2021, nine months before dobbs—a multi-year upward trend in applications to ob-gyn residency slowed after the law passed. and in an unrelated national survey, 77 percent of 494 thirdand fourth-year medical students said that abortion restrictions would affect where they applied to residency, while 58 percent said they were unlikely to apply to states with a ban.\n",
      "that last survey was conducted by ariana traub and kellen \"nell\" mermin-bunnell, two third-year medical students at emory university school of medicine in atlanta—which lies within a state with a \"fetal heartbeat\" law that predates dobbs and that criminalizes providing an abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. the law means that students in clinical rotations are unlikely to witness abortions and would not be allowed to discuss the procedure with patients. it also means that, if either of them were to become pregnant while at med school, they would not have that option themselves.\n",
      "before they published the survey, the two friends conducted an analysis of how bans would affect medical school curricula, using data collected in the summer of 2022. they predicted that only 29 percent of the more than 129,000 medical students in the us would not be affected by state bans. the survey gave them a chance to sample med students' feelings about those developments, with the help of faculty members. they also founded a nonprofit, georgia healthcare professionals for reproductive justice. \"we're in a unique position, as individuals in the health care field but not necessarily medical professionals yet,\" traub says. \"we have some freedom. so we felt like we had to use that power to try to make change.\"\n",
      "the conflict between what medicine demands and state laws prevent leaves new and would-be doctors in restrictive states struggling with their inability to follow medical evidence and their own best intentions. \"i'm starting to take care of patients for the first time in my life,\" says mermin-bunnell, traub's survey partner. \"seeing a human being in front of you, who needs your help, and not being able to help them or even talk to them about what their options might be—it feels morally wrong.\"\n",
      "that frustration is equally evident among trainees in specialties who might treat a pregnant person, prescribe treatments that could imperil a pregnancy, or care for a pregnancy gone wrong. those include family and adolescent medicine, anesthesiology, radiology, rheumatology, even dermatology and mental health.\n",
      "\"i'm particularly interested in oncology, and i've come to realize that you can't have the full standard of gynecologic oncology care without being able to have access to abortion care,\" says morgan levy, a fourth-year medical student in florida who plans to apply to ob-gyn residency. florida currently bans abortion after 15 weeks; a further ban, down to six weeks, passed in april but has been held up by legal challenges. in three years of med school so far, levy received one lecture on abortion—in the context of miscarriage—and no clinical exposure to the procedure. \"it is a priority for me to make sure that i get trained,\" she says.\n",
      "but landing in a training program that encourages abortion practice is more difficult than it looks. residency application is an algorithm-driven process in which graduates list their preferred programs, and faculty rank the trainees they want to teach. for years, there have been more applicants than there are spaces—and this year, as in the past, ob-gyn programs filled almost all their slots. what that means, according to faculty members, is that some applicants will end up where they do not want to be.\n",
      "\"students and trainees do exert their preferences, but they also need to get a training spot,\" says vineet arora, the dean for medical education at the university of chicago pritzker school of medicine and lead author on the survey published in february. \"would they forgo a training spot because of dobbs? that's a tall order, especially in a competitive field. but would they be happy about it? and would they want to stay there long term?\"\n",
      "that is not a hypothetical question. according to the medical-colleges association, more than half of residents stay to practice in the states where they trained. but it's reasonable to ask whether they would feel that loyalty if they were deprived of training or forced to relocate. \"if even a portion of the 80 percent of people who prefer to practice and train in states that don't have abortion bans follow through on those preferences, those states that are putting in abortion bans—which often have workforce shortages already—will be in a worse situation,\" arora says.\n",
      "an acog analysis estimated in 2017 that half of us counties, which are home to 10 million women, have no practicing ob-gyn. when the health care tech firm doximity examined ob-gyn workloads in 2019, seven of the 10 cities it identified as having the highest workloads lie in what are now very restrictive states. those shortages are likely to worsen if new doctors relocate to states where they feel safe. the legal and consulting firm manatt health predicted in a white paper last fall: \"the impact on access to all ob/gyn care in certain geographies could be catastrophic.\"\n",
      "steinauer directs the kenneth j. ryan residency training program, a 24-year-old effort to install and reinforce clinical abortion training. even before dobbs, that was hard to come by: in 2018, steinauer and colleagues estimated that only two-thirds of ob-gyn residency programs made it routine, despite accreditation requirements—and that anywhere from 29 to 78 percent of residents couldn't competently perform different types of abortion when they left training. in 2020, researchers from ucsf and uc berkeley documented that 57 percent of these programs face limitations set by individual hospitals more extreme than those set by states.\n",
      "before dobbs, the ryan program brokered individual relocations that let trainees temporarily transfer to other institutions. now it is working to set up program-to-program agreements instead, because the logistics required to visit for a rotation—the kind of arrangements fishbach dizzily imagined a year ago—are more complex than most people can manage on their own. and not only on the visiting trainee: programs already perform delicate calculations of how many trainees they can take given the number of patients coming to their institutions and the number of faculty mentors.\n",
      "only a few places have managed to institutionalize \"away rotations,\" in which they align accreditation milestones, training time, and financing with other institutions. oregon health & science university's school of medicine is about to open a formal program that will accept 10 to 12 residents from restrictive states for a month each over a year. oregon imposes no restrictions on abortion, and both the med school's existing residents and the university's philanthropic foundation supported the move.\n",
      "\"i'm very concerned about having a future generation that knows how to provide safe abortion care—because abortion will never go away; becoming illegal only makes it less safe,\" says alyssa colwill, who oversees the new program and is an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology. \"there are going to be patients that are going to use unsafe methods because there's no other alternative. and providers are going to be placed in scenarios that are heartbreaking, and are devastating to watch.\"\n",
      "this isn't imaginary: already, research has shown that physicians practicing in red states are less likely to offer appropriate and legal procedures to treat miscarriages. receiving abortion training, in other words, also improves medical care for pregnancy loss.\n",
      "\"ultimately, i do not think there is capacity to train every resident who wants training,\" says charisse loder, a clinical assistant professor of ob-gyn at the university of michigan medical school, who directs the program where fishbach is training. \"so we will have ob-gyn residents who are not trained in this care. and i think that is not only unfortunate, but puts patients in a position of being cared for by residents who don't have comprehensive training.\"\n",
      "doing only short rotations also returns residents to places where their own reproductive health could be put at risk. future physicians are likely to be older than in previous generations, having been encouraged to get life experience and sample other careers before entering med school. research on which levy and arora collaborated in 2022 shows that more than 11 percent of new physicians had abortions during their training. because of the length of training, they also may be more likely to use ivf when they are ready to start families—and some reproductive technologies may be criminalized under current abortion bans.\n",
      "as a fourth and final-year psychiatry resident, simone bernstein had thought about abortion restrictions through the lens of her patients' mental health, as she talked to them about fertility treatment and pregnancy loss. as cofounder of the online platform inside the match, she had listened to residents' reactions to dobbs (and collaborated on research with levy and arora). she had not expected the decision to affect her personally—but she is in missouri, a state where there is an almost complete ban on abortion. and this spring, she experienced a miscarriage at 13 weeks of pregnancy.\n",
      "\"i was worried whether or not i could even go to the hospital, if my baby still had a heartbeat, which was a conversation that i had to have with my ob-gyn on the phone,\" she says. \"it didn't come to that; i caught the baby in my hands at home, hemorrhaging blood everywhere, and the baby had already passed away. but until that moment, i didn't recognize the effects that [abortion restrictions] could have on me.\"\n",
      "this is the reality now: there exist very few places in the us where abortion is uncomplicated. faculty and their trainees do not expect that to change, except for the worse. staying in the field, and making sure the next generation is prepared, requires commitment that they will have to sustain for years.\n",
      "\"part of the reason why i sought advanced training in abortion and contraception is because i think there will be a national ban,\" says abigail liberty, an ob-gyn and fellow in her sixth postgraduate year at ohsu. \"i think it will happen in our lifetime. and i see my role as getting as much expertise and training as i can now and providing care while i can. and then coming out of retirement, when abortion will be legal again, and training the next generation of physicians.\" \n",

      "Author(s): Elissaveta M. Brandon\n",
      "Title: Ryuichi Sakamoto’s Final Performance Is a Virtual-Only Engagement\n",
      "the performance lasts about 45 minutes. the oscar-winning composer plays 10 of his own compositions, and at the end of every piece, people clap. not me at first, but i make up for it with tears, which first build up in my throat, then stream down my cheeks. when it's over, sakamoto doesn't bow and walk off the stage; he passed away in march this year after a years-long battle with cancer. he just fades into black as i take off the headset i am wearing.\n",
      "kagami, as the music performance is called, is a mixed-reality show on view through july 9 at the shed in manhattan and at factory international in manchester, with runs at the sydney opera house and the big ears festival in knoxville, tennessee, up next. the show begins with 80 people sitting in a circle around absolutely nothing. after each concertgoer has slid on a magic leap 2 headset, a virtual sakamoto appears in the center of the circle. the musician then performs as you mosey \"around\" him, being ever so careful not to bump into a piano that doesn't exist—or your fellow attendees, who do.\n",
      "kagami—japanese for \"mirror\"—was designed by the production studio tin drum, and fuses a 3d model of sakamoto with the real world, resulting in an experience that feels material and ethereal at once. it is part of an ever-growing cohort of musical experimentations with ar and vr. in the thick of the pandemic in 2020, billie eilish performed a livestreamed concert jazzed up with extended reality effects that turned the stage into a gloomy ocean floor and a star-studded sky. in 2022, gorillaz took over new york's times square, then london's piccadilly circus, as ar technology brought the band's characters to life on giant screens. the list goes on to include ariana grande, justin bieber, and travis scott, most of whom started to dabble with mixed-reality during the pandemic.\n",
      "fast forward to november 2020, and both men flew from new york city, where they were based, to locked-down tokyo, one of only two cities in the world with the setup necessary to capture sakamoto in 3d and generate a virtual model of him using volumetric and motion capture technology. the session lasted three days, during which sakamoto played his compositions under the scrutiny of 48 cameras, various microphones, and lightboxes.\n",
      "there was nothing glamorous about it: every surface around him, piano included, was covered in green—\"kermit land,\" jokes eckert. sakamoto was wearing lentil-sized motion capture markers on his face, with almost 20 of them strategically taped to the back of his hands. his thin silver hair, which normally falls over his forehead, was waxed back and held under a net so it didn't hide his facial expressions from the cameras. \"in service of making something authentic you have to go through impossible odds and processes that seem inauthentic,\" says eckert.\n",
      "it took about six months for eckert's team to process the raw data captured in the session. in the meantime, they also had to sculpt sakamoto's hair from scratch and recreate his iconic glasses. but the most challenging thing to recreate was sakamoto's face, which was blocked from the cameras for a large part of his performance because he was hunched over.\n",
      "maybe that's because the morning before the first session started, sakamoto had learned the cancer was back, and it was everywhere. \"i didn't find out what he had found out until a year and a half later,\" says eckert, conjecturing that maybe sakamoto knew he was going to die soon, so he was leaning over the piano more than usual. \"these are the slowest versions of these songs he ever did,\" says eckert.\n",
      "because the team had inconsistent data of sakamoto's face, both in form and texture, they had to make up for the missing data by reconstructing his face using referencing segments of complete data. it took months.\n",
      "meanwhile, separate teams were working on a series of 3d artworks that would end up accompanying the performance: gentle fog that curls around everyone's ankles for the opening piece; a tree that draws itself on top of the piano a bit later. \"it was never my intention to simply service people who knew they loved ryuichi, but to try to expand the audience that would come to understand his work,\" says eckert. luckily, the artworks elevate the performance instead of detracting from it. while sakamoto is playing the hit track \"energy flow,\" for example, a window opens high above him, and snowflakes start floating through it. the snow effect references akira kurosawa's 1952 film ikiru, where the main character—an elderly man who knows he will die soon—spends his final moments sitting on a park swing during a snowfall, singing a romantic ballad.\n",
      "the entire show feels otherworldly, but there's only so much technology can achieve. the magic leap 2 has a 70-degree field of view, which is twice as big as the previous iteration, but it still means that when you look up at the ceiling to see that window, you can no longer see sakamoto. the headset is also tricky to get used to, considering you're walking around in a room full of strangers wearing the equivalent of dark sunglasses. (the magic leap 2 comes with a dimming feature that allows real objects to slip behind virtual ones, but the illusion was so strong that people kept bumping into each other at test shows, so the team had to disable it.)\n",
      "surreal as it was, the performance left me somewhat puzzled. can a mixed-reality concert ever make up for the sad reality of someone's absence? i have never seen sakamoto play live, but i doubt kagami comes close to the palpable energy of his presence in the room. what do we lose when technology becomes so integral to the most intimate of human experiences—and what do we gain?\n",
      "indre viskontas, a neuroscientist and operatic soprano who serves on the faculty at the san francisco conservatory of music, says that knowing who wrote the piece can affect how people experience it too. in 2013, a team of researchers ran a neuroimaging study in which they asked people to lie in a scanner and listen to a piece of music that was the same for everyone. one half was told the music was composed by a human, and the other half was told it was composed by a machine. the first group, viskontas says, engaged a part of the brain that helps us understand how other people feel, think, and behave. in other words, when people knew the composer was human, they had more empathy. \"one of the things we do as humans is try to understand, 'what is that human being trying to tell me, what are their beliefs, are they friend or foe?' and we do that by essentially trying to put ourselves in the shoes of that person,\" viskontas says.\n",
      "viskontas acknowledges that the same study might yield different results if it were performed today, when our culture is steeped in ai-generated music and art. it's also a bit different considering sakamoto was human, and was performing his own songs for the recording—it was just his presence that was relayed through a machine. but according to viskontas, the connection the public forms with him in mixed reality can only work if we buy into the illusion of a performer in the room, playing the piano—and if the technology is advanced enough to help us convince ourselves that it is real.\n",
      "the latter may take a while. as outlined in a 2016 study, in order for vr technology to truly make us feel like we are present in a room with a performer and an audience, it needs to better translate subtle physical changes in the performer like blushing and sweating, or almost imperceptible things like the raising of an eyebrow. it would also have to give us the option of physical contact with those around us. replicating the unique energy and atmosphere that stems from the collective presence of performers and the audience being in the venue together is another challenge. this is only partly addressed in kagami, which may be designed for a small crowd to take in together, but remains a mostly solitary experience.\n",
      "still, the show remains a captivating attempt at capturing the impossible and freezing it in time. with no room for improv, sakamoto will display the exact same emotions every single time the performance runs. will the magic fade away if i go back a second time?\n",
      "perhaps sakamoto knew the stakes. reflecting on kagami in early 2023, shortly before his death, he wrote: \"there is, in reality, a virtual me. this virtual me will not age, and will continue to play the piano for years, decades, centuries ... will there be empathy there? empathy that spans hundreds of thousands of years. ah, but the batteries won't last that long.\" \n",

the fire max 11 delivers what amazon is promising, which is to say it's by far the best fire tablet the company has ever made.the 11-inch lcd screen has a nice 2,000 x 1,200-pixel resolution that's quite glare-prone, but no worse than other tablets. the 16:9 format signals that the first priority here is consuming movies (and reading, if you rotate to portrait mode), but it's not great for productivity. it could be if amazon updated fire os to access some of the tools in android 12l, which is optimized for tablets, but fire os is based on an outdated version of android that lacks any tablet-friendly features. more on that in a minute.there's a fingerprint reader on the side power button, which is a first for a fire tablet. a microsd slot lets you expand your media storage, and the keyboard now connects via pogo pins, which allow it to charge and communicate. previous fire tablets—like mine—need to connect to keyboards via bluetooth, which is inconsistent and slow on the best of days and must be charged separately. the fire max 11 also supports wi-fi 6 and has front and rear 8-megapixel cameras, making it better for video chats as well.under the screen sit 4 gigabytes of ram and either a 64-gigabyte or 128-gigabyte ssd (the larger storage adds another $50). the max 11 is powered by a mediatek mt8188j chip, which uses an 8-core processor. those specs put the fire max 11 in the middle of most android tablets—more powerful than its fire siblings, but certainly not close to any oneplus or pixel tablet. for amazon though, this qualifies as a high-end slate, relative to the rest of the fire lineup.amazon fire max 11rating: 5/10$230 at amazon$330 at amazon (productivity bundle)if you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. this helps support our journalism. learn more. please also consider subscribing to wiredit's made of metal and feels much nicer than any other fire device. after using it for several weeks, i was a little sad to go back to my plasticky fire 10. the fire max 11 is also noticeably faster in performance, though not enough that i would feel compelled to upgrade. one potential deal-breaker is that the keyboard and case are not self-supporting. to be productive with the productivity bundle, you need to put the whole thing on a flat surface.the keyboard, while usable, is on the small side. i had a lot of trouble with the trackpad, which kept clicking things when i accidentally brushed it with my palms while typing. it's not an insurmountable issue, but it's more annoying than it should be at this price. the stylus is laughably bad. luckily for users, there are almost no apps in the amazon app store that would make you want to use the stylus.prime timephotograph: amazonthe core problem with the fire max 11 is that it's just not good enough for the money amazon is charging. if you want to use it for anything more than a firehose blasting your eyeballs with prime content, you'll have to spend $330. given that you can get a 9th-generation ipad on amazon for roughly $279 and a bluetooth keyboard for $30 more, why would anyone buy a fire max 11? i don't know.it's an ok tablet, but it's nowhere near as powerful as even the base model ipad, the pixel tablet, the oneplus pad, or the second generation of lenovo's tab p11 pro. most of these tablets cost more, yes, but they're better investments for all but the most diehard amazon fan (if such people exist).the reason you should buy something else comes down to software. fire os, amazon's proprietary fork of android, is terrible. it's always been terrible, and as far as i can tell, it will always be terrible. its sole purpose is to deliver your eyeballs to amazon. it works well for that. you'll have no trouble finding all your favorite amazon prime features and perks through fire os.if you want to do anything else, you'll find yourself fighting fire os to get it done. there are no google apps and no play store, only the limited offerings of amazon's app store. i did try to install the play store using my own instructions, but so far i have not been able to get it working. i will update that guide as soon as i figure it out, but lenovo's tab p11 pro is still a better investment for roughly the same price.amazon fire max 11rating: 5/10$230 at amazon$330 at amazon (productivity bundle)if you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. this helps support our journalism. learn more. please also consider subscribing to wired$230 at amazon$330 at amazon (productivity bundle) \n",

      "the line comes early in the game, right after our coiffured all-american hero has seen his police escort burned alive. leon is about to be butchered by pitchfork and chainsaw-wielding spanish farmers, but then a tolling bell suddenly psychically summons them away. the line is amazingly stupid, and if he doesn't say it, i thought after seeing news of the demo, i'm joining the mob outside the capcom offices. (reader, rest assured, the villagers attended bingo.)\n",
      "the culture industry loves a remake; it also loves a reboot, a remaster, a sequel, a prequel, a multiverse, and a cinematic universe. in a recent long read for vulture, writers josef adalian and lane brown warned that tv is headed into an era of \"safe ideas,\" comparing the times to come to the movie industry of the 2010s. brand recognition and cultural stagnation await; harry potter and twilight series are in the works. other media also run the risk of falling into this same trap; that's the danger with sure things.\n",
      "of course, there is nothing inherently debased about remakes. no remakes, no scarface or true grit; in a broad sense, shakespeare made a career of it. it is a censorious and misguided impulse to claim that a remake undermines its subject. you might find it harder to convince someone to watch the original wicker man if they've just sat through nick cage hollering about bees (not me, that movie rocks), but in general, this logic is weird math. where there was one, now there are two. a remake is just an interpretation—it should not replace the original.\n",
      "but for video games, the math is often a subtraction. so far this year, studios have reimagined four classic games (to varying degrees of change) brilliantly: resident evil 4, metroid prime, dead space, and, most recently, system shock, possibly heralding a remake golden age.\n",
      "contrary to other artforms, there is a tendency in the games industry to talk about remakes as replacements. this is not to say that the history of film and literature isn't also riddled with innumerable losses, great works burned up in disasters or walled off on obscure streaming platforms. but with video games, where old versions get swapped out for the new ones on platforms like steam or the playstation store, the replacement of the original work is particularly baked into the process. and a remake is not a replacement, no matter how superior.\n",
      "in this vein, one type of remake is a simple \"remaster,\" like metroid prime, which sharpened the graphics to meet fans' nostalgia-filtered memories. this kind of upgrade is often enough to impress punters: bluepoint studios beautified demon's souls to such an extent that it supposedly put pressure on the graphics team working on elden ring.\n",
      "but there are deeper ways a developer can remake a game. mark brown of the game maker's toolkit broke these down recently in a youtube video about the resident evil 4 reboot titled \"why capcom is the king of remakes.\" the first is \"modernization,\" adding newer gameplay concepts like fast travel and quicksave. the second is addressing criticism: the artist gets to go back and fix all the inevitable galling failures that make revisiting art so painful. (if only writers could do this with their pieces.) and the final is accessibility. sometimes making goals easier or clearer; other times it means adding in options for disabled players. brown argued that by accomplishing all three, capcom made re4 feel fresh to old fans and neophytes alike.\n",
      "but crucially, brown points out, the original resident evil 4 is still available. not so for titles like warcraft iii: reforged and the remake of grand theft auto: san andreas, both of which erased their previous iterations in favor of inferior remasters. this conundrum grows out of the public's relationship with consumer technologies. games are tied to the development of tech like processors and gpus; this means that games are also tied to the false vision of technological progress as a straight line of continuous improvement rather than a chaotic series of hit-or-miss implementations. video games often seem rooted in hype and obsoletion cycles, to be swept away like old iphones or social media accounts. (in this sense, games mirror the lack of preservation that exists across the internet broadly.)\n",
      "the less apparent baked-in assumption here is that games are consistently improving, rather than passing through different artistic styles and trends. this idea differs from the mindset of players who see the original as a sacred text, and get annoyed at the most minor changes in lore or voice actors. but we do not think literature improves like science, and advancements in cgi have not improved films. watch nosferatu (now being remade by robert eggers) and you'll see f. w. murnau did just fine adapting bram stoker's dracula before the advent of sound and color.\n",
      "so artistic quality does not necessarily improve in lockstep with technology. but in games, there is a tendency to equate the new with better. yet, playing these four recent remakes, i was shocked by how the things that had survived felt so good: their \"linear\" worlds did not feel old-fashioned. they fomented a desire to play the reboot and the original—and a hope that i will always be able to do both. \n",

      "Title: The Last AI Boom Didn't Kill Jobs. Feel Better?\n",
      "in a new research paper, economists looked at the job market across a number of european countries between 2011 and 2019. that's the period during which the ai technique deep learning emerged as a powerful way to automate tasks like transcribing speech, analyzing images, and making algorithmic recommendations for social feeds and ecommerce sites. back then, deep learning was widely expected to have a broad and swift impact on employment.\n",
      "to check up on what really happened, researchers at the european central bank, spain's central bank, and the universities of oxford and pittsburgh used two established methods for measuring how vulnerable professions are to ai-powered automation. both involved examining the tasks workers do and how they compare with the capabilities of algorithms. the researchers cross-referenced that information with survey data on eu workers that shows the number of people leaving or joining different occupations in industries ranging from agriculture to financial services.\n",
      "the headline result was that industries where ai could be the most useful did not see a reduction of jobs. in fact, for more highly skilled jobs vulnerable to ai, such as white-collar office work that involves working with data, there was around a 5 percent increase in the number of employed workers. the researchers say this supports the idea that new technology can increase demand for more skilled workers at the same time that it replaces those who do routine work. less skilled workers didn't seem to be significantly affected by software or ai.\n",
      "although fears about new technologies taking jobs are common—and entirely understandable—economic research offers a complex, mixed picture. in general, many economists believe that automation can increase demand for jobs overall, as shown by some recent studies. if you are not one of those more skilled workers, however, the arrival of new technology might be a problem.\n",
      "none of this research makes it possible to predict what effect chatgpt or other generative ai technologies will have. they may be too new to cause noticeable changes. and it's possible that generative ai has an entirely different effect on jobs to what came before. \"while in the period of our analysis the association is positive, these results may not be extrapolated into the future,\" the authors of the new study write.\n",
      "generative ai is undeniably already causing some disruption. you don't have to look far to find stories of individuals and businesses that are already being changed by the kind of ai behind chatgpt.\n",
      "some copywriters, for instance, are having to find new careers after customers replaced them with generative ai tools. a number of publications are also experimenting with ai-generated content. the german tabloid bild recently cited ai as one reason for planned job cuts.\n",
      "but let's not forget that tools like chatgpt are still unreliable coworkers, as they make up facts, reinforce biases, and can otherwise misbehave. and it's worth remembering that the emergence of deep learning in the 2010s prompted some ai experts to predict the elimination of certain jobs, including radiologists—a prognostication that has hardly come true. \n",

      "Title: Could a Dutch apology for empire and slavery set a royal trend?\n",
      "is late truly better than never?  when king willem-alexander of the netherlands commemorates the 160th anniversary of the country's abolition of slavery on saturday (july 1), he is widely expected to apologize for the dutch imperial slave trade. the weight of history is bearing down on the king. for decades campaigners in former dutch colonies in the caribbean have called on the netherlands to apologize and pay reparations for the brutal and systematic trade in human lives in the 17th and 18th centuries.  the netherlands' reckoning with its past comes as some in europe grapple with the realities of their brutal colonial and slave-holding history. an apology, which is widely expected, would pile pressure on the royal families of britain, belgium and other former slave-trading european nations to do the same. the dutch royal palace said it does not comment on the king's upcoming speeches. still, anything short of an apology would cause uproar among activists. in december prime minister mark rutte apologized on behalf of the dutch government to the descendants of enslaved people. and on june 15, the sheer extent of dutch colonial enslavement was laid bare in a new government-funded academic study called state and slavery that forensically tells the story of how the small north sea nation became a world-leading economy in large part through its exploitation of forced labor. the netherlands' vast, lucrative network of human trafficking saw hundreds of thousands of people stolen from africa and sold in the caribbean and east asia — something that until now has not been widely known by the country's citizens, according to the study. it also doesn't fit the popular image of holland — as many netherlanders still call it — as a multicultural and tolerant democracy with a modern bicycle-riding royal family. the study also describes how the king's predecessors made the equivalent of almost $600 million from the slave trade, having invested nothing at the trade's height in the 17th and 18th centuries, more than 1,000 enslaved people were taken to suriname every year to work on sugar plantations, according to state and slavery.  more than 90% of the population in what was then a south american colony were enslaved and conditions were so harsh that the number of births never outpaced the number of deaths, the study showed. the study's findings have surprised many in the netherlands, including those who read advance copies, said one of its editors, esther captain, an expert at the royal netherlands institute of southeast asian and caribbean studies, in the dutch city of leiden. \"i was shocked because you would assume that [it is] basic in general knowledge, but it's not,\" she told nbc news by telephone. \"i think it is to do with the fact that this is confronting our self-image. we used to sell ourselves as tolerant, open-minded and democratic. and i think this is challenging our very self image, and that hurts.\" the church, the navy and the royal family each played a part in the human trafficking of an estimated 600,000 people, mainly to suriname and the antilles islands in the caribbean. successive generations were born into this often deadly cycle of servitude.  plantation owners busied themselves with reading, writing, sports and other leisure pursuits as workers toiled in the hot sun while facing physical and sexual abuse. the dutch began trading slaves in the 1500s and became a major player in the 1600s. slavery only ended in the dutch caribbean islands and suriname in 1863 — although some slaves were not freed for another 10 years. the netherlands relented in the face of international pressure, not least from britain, which ended its part in the atlantic slave trade in 1808. (the united states abolished slavery in 1865.) slavery was also enforced in the dutch east indies — a major colony that included modern-day indonesia — until the 19th century. in response to questions from nbc news, pauline van voorst, a spokesperson for the dutch government, echoed rutte's apology in admitting the country had too late in acting on the legacy of slavery.  \"for centuries, under dutch state authority, human dignity was violated in the most horrific way possible. and successive dutch governments after 1863 failed to adequately see and acknowledge that our slavery past continued to have negative effects and still does,\" she said. on the question of reparations, she said that various assistance packages were already in place to help former colonies, designed to improve local economies.  the state and slavery project was funded by a 200 million euro (about $218 million) commission to explore and expose the country's colonial past, announced by rutte in december. some countries have made similar moves and even paid reparations. king charles iii said in april that buckingham palace will cooperate with research into the british royalty's links to slavery, and belgium set up a commission to study its links in 2020. belgian lawmakers spent hours last year debating whether and how to make an apology but came to no agreement, and the british project is not due to complete until 2026.  belgium's king philippe expressed his \"deepest regrets\" last june while on a trip to the democratic republic of the congo, where from 1885 to 1908 the government, under the supervision of king leopold ii, extracted a fortune in natural resources while enslaving, maiming, torturing and killing many thousands of people. britain has \"fallen behind the international conversation\" in owning up to its colonial past, said sathnam sanghera, a journalist and author of \"empireland,\" a bestselling 2021 book about the legacy of british colonialism.  \"that the dutch have commissioned historians and given an apology just highlights how little we've done,\" he said. king charles' coronation, which included items glittering with precious gems taken from british colonies, underlined britain's imperial past. \"it kept coming up during the coronation, every other commonwealth was raising it, whether it was loot, slavery or the legacy of it,\" sanghera said. \"this is going to be the conversation for the next 20 years.\" britain was an early and enthusiastic participant in the transatlantic slave trade in the 16th and 17th centuries, which helped build an empire that reigned over some 400 million inhabitants at its height in the early 20th century. in 2021, germany called its actions in namibia \"genocide\" and pledged 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in reparations, and the same year french president emmanuel macron apologized to algerians who fought alongside french forces but were later killed as traitors. \"you have germany doing that, you have the netherlands doing that. and it pressures belgium, who have kind of stuck their heels in the sand,\" said jeremiah garsha, an expert in colonial history at university college dublin. the state and slavery project made headlines last week for revealing how much money dutch kings made from slavery. but garsha added that reducing an entire country's colonial misdeeds to a number is in itself a continuation of the colonial attitude: that people can be financial assets. \"those are numbers that continue to kind of enslave people in our mindset — they're chattel, they're property. no. these are experiences, these are human experiences,\" he said. \"that's what i want to recover.\" \n",

      "a train carrying hazardous materials derailed and a bridge collapsed into a southern montana river saturday, sending rail cars into the water and prompting concerns about contamination.  some of those fears may have been allayed by evening as rail officials said two cars known to be carrying sodium hydro sulfate, which can burn, irritate and cause shortness of breath, had not entered the yellowstone river below the failed bridge.  no hazardous materials were released from those particular rail cars, said andy garland, a spokesperson for montana rail link.  but an unspecified number of other cars containing molten sulfur and asphalt had been \"compromised,\" he said in a statement. officials will continue to monitor the derailment site, he said. no injuries were reported, officials said.  as many as eight cars derailed, columbus, montana, fire chief rich cowger told nbc affiliate kulr of billings. billings said in a statement that it would shut down city water system intakes fed by the yellowstone river for the time any pollutant would need to pass and end up downstream. billings, a city of nearly 110,000 people, has a clean supply of drinking water in its system, including storage tanks that are full, it said. laurel, montana, suspended its intake from the river and temporarily shut down its water treatment plant saturday morning, but a few hours later it reconnected its supply and restarted treatment, officials said in a statement. laurel officials visited the derailment site and investigated the water system, the statement said. water treatment plants in yellowstone county were working as normal as officials monitored the river for any signs of contaminants, county officials said in a statement. \"at this time there have been no reported negative impacts to yellowstone county,\" its government said in a statement. the train derailed and the bridge collapsed about 6 a.m. near the community of reed point, said officials in stillwater county, which abuts yellowstone county. the bridge over the yellowstone river was described as a rail bridge in the statement saturday. the national transportation safety board said in a statement saturday evening that it is sending an investigative team to the derailment site. the federal railroad administration is leading the inquiry, the ntsb said. it was not immediately clear whether the collapse or the derailment happened first or what caused either.  asphalt contains carcinogens, and it has been linked to some forms of cancer. molten sulfur can cause serious thermal burns upon contact and will form toxic and flammable gases when it reacts to hydrocarbon, a compound at the heart of fossil fuels. \n",

      "Title: The 'moment has arrived' for digital creators. And they're here for it.\n",
      "anaheim, calif. — as vidcon has matured in recent years, so too have its attendees.  this year the annual conference — for creators, fans and industry execs — brought together the likes of hollywood a-list star keke palmer and youtube minecraft streamer dream. it also featured such panels as \"the new era of celebrity\" and \"stream to mainstream: hollywood's new rules of engagement.\" online content — often dismissed as less impressive or serious than traditional media — is proving to be an unignorable force in entertainment as the lines between digital, film and tv continue to blur. \"i mean, this in the nicest way,\" ian hecox, co-founder of og youtube comedy channel smosh, said. vidcon has \"gone from weirdos to entrepreneurs.\" young people have increasingly turned to online video for entertainment. during the pandemic lockdown in 2020, digital content on platforms like youtube and tiktok dominated, which experts at vidcon said helped propel digital media as a serious form of entertainment.  \"we're not on a journey anymore,\" said amber tarshis, chief marketing officer at creator economy startup jellysmack. \"the moment has arrived. digital-first talent are the power players today.\" with everyone at home, audiences ran out of new shows to watch on tv or stream, but creators kept people entertained with fresh content everyday.  \"it really drove people into watching creators, not as a hobby thing but as another linear option,\" said joe gagliese, ceo of viral nation, an influencer marketing and talent management company.   gagliese said that when he co-founded viral nation in 2014, many creators believed that the next step in their careers had to be crossing over to mainstream media.  but creators are no longer just using social media as a jumping off point for bigger stardom. instead, online content is the end goal. over the years, content creation has become a serious and feasible career option for many. \"they all thought that the natural evolution of being a creator was becoming a celebrity,\" gagliese said. \"as the years went on, and some of them made the crossover and realized, 'i gotta go work a 13-hour day for 1,200 bucks and they don't care who i am.' ... so they realize that like, that's a whole different grind than what they're used to.\" the transition from digital to mainstream media has not always been smooth, partly because executives have tried to force traditional growth models onto new-age talent. in general, the relationship between digital talent and the hollywood executives who invest in them has been fraught in the past. creators felt many people coming from the traditional entertainment industry didn't \"get\" the internet.  hecox and anthony padilla, co-creators of smosh, can attest to this. the duo, who recently reunited after splitting up in 2017 to buy the brand back, has experienced the different phases and investments in the creator space since the two started their channel in 2005.  \"they had a lot of institutional knowledge from how things worked in a traditional space,\" hecox said of the first executives who tapped into digital. \"it wasn't really one for one when it came to digital. so there's just a lot of stuff that just wasn't very productive in the digital space. it's a very different world. it's a lot less money.\" the directive from some executives smosh worked with, padilla said, was to incorporate different elements into its youtube videos because they believed it would \"help the overall business.\" hecox said that toward the end of his and padilla's initial partnership, they gave priority to production quality in a way their audience didn't like. \"we had strayed too far away from digital and we started looking more like tv, and i think people didn't connect with that,\" hecox said. padilla and hecox now own their brand and have creative control over it. instead of stretching themselves thin to fit a traditional mold, they've redirected their focus to their roots and what fans liked the best.  the entertainment industry has gradually improved its handling of digital creators, according to jade sherman, head of digital at a3 artists agency. sherman said in the early days some agencies treated digital as \"the ugly stepchild\" of the industry. now \"people aren't trying to fit digital talent into a traditional kind of medium and then just dropping them and saying good luck,\" she said.  \"they're really trying to figure out, why should we be working with this creator in this kind of format? what makes it more impactful? what makes it different than what they're already doing? and the truth is, sometimes maybe that's not an option.\" alan chikin chow, who is represented by a3, started his career as an actor but pivoted his focus to social media content, which has led to him becoming the most-viewed youtube shorts creator with a dedicated fanbase. while he still takes on traditional projects, he said youtube has allowed him to create comedy and tell stories on his own terms. \"i think the thing that is really exciting about being a creator is you have the power to create your own brand, create your own voice, and really distill what it is that you want to say, without having to kind of fit into the narrative of somebody else's project,\" he said.  traditional stars are increasingly seeing the value of digital content. superstars like dwayne \"the rock\" johnson and will smith have made successful and popular online content for years. now people like palmer and former disney channel actor christy carlson romano are building digital-first media companies because of the creative freedom and reach they can achieve with that. romano said she wished she'd started making online content sooner, because it has allowed her to control her image, narrative and creative pursuits. she also said that she identifies as a content creator rather than a celebrity these days. \"it's as if you were your own network,\" romano said. \"i didn't need to wait for anybody anymore, and i would be the only person benefiting from my efforts. so it's very, very empowering.\" while creators and industry insiders are optimistic about the future of digital media, some say there's still a lot of work to be done.  \"anything that becomes the main thing has problems,\" gagliese, of viral nation, said. \"so i think you'll see a lot of growing pains ... but if you can make it through the growing pains, and you can find that kind of steady space,\" this industry, he said, \"is going to become a monster.\" \n",

      "if you have an iphone, you probably know about the helpful function of \"siri,\" or your apple virtual assistant. depending on how you set up your phone, if you hold down the side button (or home button if your model has one) or say \"hey siri,\" you'll easily activate the feature.&nbsp; click to get kurt's free cyberguy newsletter with security alerts, quick tips, tech reviews and easy how-to's to make you smarter&nbsp; you may use siri to call friends or family, send texts, and maybe you occasionally ask a question. however, did you know about these 10 super-helpful features? before we get there, you have to make sure siri is enabled on your iphone by following these steps:&nbsp; how to enable siri on iphone  open the settings app on your iphone&nbsp; scroll down and tap on siri &amp; search. note: on some older ios versions, siri settings might be found under general or accessibility&nbsp; 5 amazing siri hacks you'll want to use all the time make sure the listen for 'hey siri' is toggled on. this allows siri to be activated by voice commands&nbsp; if you want siri to respond when your device is face down or covered, enable the allow siri when locked option. note: enabling this option may have privacy implications, as siri can be accessed even when your device is locked.&nbsp; you can also customize siri's voice and language settings on this screen by selecting siri voice and language options.&nbsp; once you have enabled siri, you can activate it by either pressing and holding the home button (on iphone models with a home button) or by saying \"hey siri\" followed by your command (if the \"listen for 'hey siri'\" option is enabled). siri should now be active and ready to assist you on your iphone. now that you have siri set up. let's dive into 10 hidden siri features that can be super helpful.&nbsp; top 10 hidden siri features  1. customized pronunciation   if you use siri to call contacts, you may have experienced the voice mispronouncing a name. you can actually teach siri how to say your loved ones' names properly thanks to a type of field that can be added to the person's contact on your iphone.&nbsp;&nbsp; first, the next time siri mispronounces a name, to fix this you can say, \"hey siri, that's not how you pronounce [name]\".&nbsp; siri will then prompt you to do the following (or can proceed to do this now if you'd like)&nbsp; launch the contacts app on your ‌iphone‌&nbsp; select a person in your contacts&nbsp; tap edit in the top right corner&nbsp; under the \"notes\" section, tap add field&nbsp; select pronunciation first name or pronunciation second name, depending on which name ‌siri‌ is having trouble with&nbsp; next, tap the pronunciation field and spell out the name phonetically (how it sounds)&nbsp; tap done in the top-right corner when you're finished.&nbsp; the next time ‌siri‌ says the name, it will follow your phonetic spelling.&nbsp; 2. remember where you parked your car   not only can you use siri to help you remember where you parked your car, the assistant can also help you find your car if needed. iphones are great at identifying when you've parked and left the location, yet if you ever want to be certain about where your car is, you can drop a pin on your maps app by using siri.&nbsp; just say, \"hey siri, remember where i parked my car\" before you leave the spot. then you can retrieve the parking lot location when you want to find your parked car.&nbsp; just ask siri by saying, \"hey siri, where did i park my car?\" siri will then provide you with the information it stored about your parking location, such as the address or a map with directions to your car.&nbsp; 3. use siri to find an airtag   if you use apple airtags, you know how helpful they are for keeping track of keys, your pets, or any other device you attach them to. you may not have realized this, but you can use siri to find your airtags if they're within bluetooth range.&nbsp; just say, \"hey siri, find my airtag.\" then, depending on the location, siri may provide guidance on which direction it is in relation to where you are, or it may tell you if your airtag is nearby.&nbsp; more: airtag tracker detector warns of stalkers in seconds&nbsp; 4. set up reminders for specific apps   siri can set reminders for apps on your device, and you can tell siri exactly when or where you want to be reminded.&nbsp; for instance, if your iphone has your home location set up, you can say, \"hey siri, remind me to check my email when i get home,\" and siri will create a reminder to open the mail app when you arrive at that address. you can also say, \"hey siri, remind me to open [app name],\" and specify a time for that reminder to pop up on your iphone.&nbsp; in order for this feature to work, you will need to enable location services from the reminders app. here's how:&nbsp; open the settings app on your iphone&nbsp; scroll down and tap on privacy &amp; security&nbsp; in the privacy settings, select location services&nbsp; from here, you have a couple of options:&nbsp; if location services are turned off entirely, you'll need to toggle the switch on at the top to enable them. you may be prompted to enter your device passcode or use touch id/face id to make changes.&nbsp; if location services are already enabled, scroll down to find the reminders app in the list and tap on it.&nbsp; now, you should see three options: never, while using the app, and always. choose either while using the app or always, depending on your preference and the level of access you want to grant to the reminders app.&nbsp; keep in mind that enabling location services may improve the functionality of certain features, but it also consumes more battery power. make sure to consider your preferences and privacy concerns when choosing the level of access to grant to any app.&nbsp; 5. keep up with sports   if you're a sports fan, you may know that siri can provide sports scores. however, did you know you can also ask siri about upcoming games, team schedules, and player information? for example, you can ask, \"hey siri, when is the next yankees game?\" or \"hey siri, what's the golden state warriors' schedule this week?\" &nbsp; 6. identify a song playing   if you're out in a coffee shop or in a store and you hear a song playing and want to know the title or artist, you can say, \"hey siri, what song is playing?\". siri will listen to the audio and try to identify the song using shazam integration. it will provide you with the song details and a link to listen to or purchase it. personally, i screenshot it, and then i can go back to save it on my streaming app later. &nbsp;

help siri understand who the contact names in your phone are by saying something like, \"hey siri, joe is my son.\"&nbsp; then, if you say, \"hey siri, call my son,\" your phone will know who you're referring to. you can also use this trick for your husband or wife, mom or dad, or just about any label you can think of.&nbsp; how to make siri listen to you longer on iphone and ipad 9. change basic settings   sometimes it's annoying to swipe to the control center or figure out where in your settings certain things are - so use siri to do it all more quickly. for example, you can tell siri to adjust these settings:&nbsp; \"hey siri, adjust the volume of my phone\"&nbsp;&nbsp; \"hey siri, turn on (or off) airplane mode\"&nbsp; \"hey siri, turn on (or off) low power mode\"&nbsp; \"hey siri, turn on (or off) bluetooth\"&nbsp;&nbsp; you can also ask siri to open settings for specific apps like chrome or your camera.&nbsp; \"hey siri, open chrome\"&nbsp; \"hey siri, open my camera\"&nbsp; 10. turn off or restart your phone   shutting down your phone or restarting it can fix a number of common glitches that happen on all technology. it's also somewhat tedious to hold down the side buttons or a combination of a side and home button, depending on your phone model. save time by having siri do it for you.&nbsp; just say, \"hey siri, restart my iphone.\"&nbsp; you can also shut down your phone using siri by saying, \"hey siri, shut down my phone,\" although you'll need to remember to turn it on manually using the buttons on the phone.&nbsp; kurt's key takeaways  siri is handy for a number of reasons, including the voice-activated convenience. for those who have reduced hand dexterity or limitations in physical movement, it's great to just be able to talk to your phone and not have to fuss around with settings or use all the different buttons our iphones come with. that makes these features particularly valuable for making iphones all-around more inclusive. plus - who doesn't love a virtual personal assistant?!&nbsp;

      "russian president vladimir putin is facing the biggest threat to his authority in decades. it comes after yevgeny prigozhin, who leads a private paramilitary group called wagner, started a violent but brief uprising against russia that may have long-lasting effects which could bring instability to putin. if putin is perceived as weakened by this assault on his leadership, then he is likely to exert aggressive strength in a show of power. how to master apple iphone's measure app for precise measurements how putin can show his strength with weaponized tech click to get kurt's free cyberguy newsletter with security alerts, quick tips, tech reviews and easy how-to's to make you smarter what few know is that vladimir putin has been building a sophisticated facial recognition surveillance system since 2017 that is likely to be put into overdrive against any citizens willing to take on the views of the russian leadership and military. more: police are using invasive facial recognition software to put every american in a perpetual lineup&nbsp;  russian surveillance technology is powered in part by silicon valley big tech companies in the u.s. facial recognition systems used by the russian government are widely available around the world.&nbsp; russia has worked with tech companies within its own walls, and belarus building sophisticated algorithms that make it highly accurate and efficient at population surveillance.&nbsp; ironically, while it seems to serve the purpose of limiting freedom, the technology works thanks to chips made by u.s. companies intel and nvidia. there is no evidence that either us company broke any export restrictions, and neither knows nor tracks how their technologies are being used.&nbsp; prior to any ban, it would have been easy for the russian government to source all the needed components to build a powerful spy mechanism to track its population. for more of my security alerts, subscribe to my free cyberguy report newsletter by heading to cyberguy.com/newsletter&nbsp;  how russian police use facial recognition surveillance to oppress its citizens police have been known to stop and detain members of the public they suspect could challenge the authority of the kremlin.&nbsp; hold up a poster that says \"freedom for russia\" and \"no to war,\" and your identity can be captured and held against you. ovd-info, a human rights organization, tracks the russian government's repression of its citizens and has identified 19,700 detained russian people dating back from may 2023. don't fall for this sneaky nameless number text scam russia's spying on its people hinges on this one public necessity it starts with the metro subway system throughout russia.&nbsp; passengers are required to scan their faces in order to gain access to a ride.&nbsp; russia has deployed \"face pay\" in at least 240 metro stations. the government claims it is the world's largest implementation of facial recognition.&nbsp; instead of a smartphone or ticket, the metro deploys facial recognition matching the russian rider with the account, location, date, and time they access a station. russian police track public protests by using facial recognition to capture the identities of protestors sweeping up as many dissenters as the surveillance system can digest. the system has been used to prevent unauthorized gatherings by blocking access to certain metro stations or sending alerts to the police. more: how to stop facial recognition cameras from monitoring your every move  when russian police sweep in to detain its citizens some hours, days, or weeks later, police located in the metro station confront russians as they arrive to scan their face to gain access to a train.&nbsp; people have reported being detained anywhere from minutes to 19 hours.&nbsp; while some alleged protestors detained led to arrest and being charged, many report strong-arming tactics being deployed by police to dissuade further protesting or showing public opposition to the government's point of view.&nbsp; it is a crime to be involved in \"public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the armed forces of the russian federation\" or to spread false information about the military, which can result in prison time from 3 to 15 years. how to keep your phone battery charged longer kurt's key takeaway if you have ever wondered why americans should be wary of similar facial recognition surveillance systems becoming a standard on u.s. soil, you need to look no further than this example of a complete loss of freedom resulting from big brother technology. the potential for abuse and erosion of individual privacy rights is a grave concern that cannot be ignored, especially when considering the potential widespread use of facial recognition surveillance systems in this country.   do you care if you are required to scan your face for access to common necessities like at your workplace, residential buildings, or even public venues?

 apple's security fixes are related to the kernel and webkit components of the ios operating system. the kernel is the core of the system that manages the hardware and software interactions, while webkit is the engine that powers the safari browser on ios devices. both of these components had flaws that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges or through malicious web content.&nbsp; 8 great iphone accessibility tips to make life easier according to kaspersky, the cybersecurity firm that reported these issues to apple, the attackers used an invisible imessage with a malicious attachment to deliver a spyware called triangledb in a zero-click attack. this spyware operates in memory and can steal various data from the infected device, such as audio recordings, photos, videos, location history, contact information, browsing history, passwords, and more.&nbsp;  how triangledb spyware can infect and monitor ios devices without user interaction  this means a person using an iphone, for example, doesn't even have to click anything or interact with anything on their phone for the spyware to infiltrate their device. this is especially serious with the kernel because it means that a hacker is getting to the core of the ios operating system without anyone clicking anything and can likely get around many security tools on the device.&nbsp; once the spyware is on an ios device, it can take audio recordings, photos, videos, location history, and more and share them with the hacker. it can also steal contact information, browsing history, passwords, and other sensitive data.&nbsp; more: the urgent iphone warning you can't afford to ignore&nbsp; who has been attacked, and should i be worried?  kaspersky reported that they found several dozen iphones that were infected with the new spyware, some of which belonged to senior employees at kaspersky. the biggest targets as of now appear to be people like journalists, politicians, business executives, human rights activists, and other high-profile figures. average civilians likely will not be attacked; however, you should still update your ios devices with this new software as soon as you can.&nbsp; how can i protect myself against this spyware?  first, the best thing you can do right now is to get this new ios 16.5.1 update onto your ios devices asap.&nbsp;  how to update your ios devices  go to settings&nbsp; select general&nbsp; tap software update &nbsp; you should see the update come up if you have not updated your device already. click install now to begin the update&nbsp;  more: a new malicious malware is specifically targeting iphones &nbsp; have antivirus software installed  second, not all of us will remember to regularly check our devices for new updates, which is why having antivirus software installed on all your devices is always a good idea. antivirus software will make sure you are stopped from clicking on any potential malicious links which may install malware on your devices, allowing hackers to gain access to your personal information. it will also be able to scan your device for malware and other viruses and warn you if it detects something suspicious. &nbsp; see my expert review of the best antivirus protection for your windows, mac, android &amp; ios devices by heading to cyberguy.com/lockupyourtech&nbsp; kurt's key takeaways  you should always be checking your settings on your devices to see if software updates are available. companies like apple put these bug fixes in place to protect you and your privacy, so you should be taking advantage of what they're providing. i'm not exactly sure why apple did not release ios 16.5.1 as a rapid security response update, a new feature that allows it to push out important upgrades on the fly. maybe they wanted the flaws to be publicly known to encourage more people to apply ios 16.5.1. whatever the reason, it is up to us to remain vigilant against these hackers who constantly seek to circumvent the rules, so make sure you're paying attention, updating your devices, and keeping your information out of the hands of these crooks.&nbsp; how frustrating is it to have to continue to update your iphone to ensure the security of your ios devices because of these types of vulnerabilities?

      "one of the few republican lawmakers who addressed his family's ties to slavery was brooks. he represented an alabama district in the house of representatives for 12 years until he lost a bid for the senate last year.\n",
      "in an interview, brooks said he hadn't known that his ancestor, great-great-great-grandfather thomas ferguson, was a slaveholder. the farmer held one person – a 7-year-old boy – in bondage in haywood county, north carolina, according to the 1860 slave schedule. reuters could find no records that show what became of the child's parents. had they died? or was the family separated, sold piecemeal to other slaveholders?\n",
      "brooks wondered whether there might be a happier story behind why the boy was listed on the schedule. \"it is hard to envision what kind of labor a 7-year-old boy could do to offset the food, shelter, clothing costs of that 7-year-old boy. which raises the issue of whether this ancestor had the boy in his possession in a traditional slavery sense, or was intending to set that boy free once he reached the age of majority,\" brooks said.\n",
      "\n",
      "manumission was \"highly unusual,\" said historian marie jenkins schwartz, author of born in bondage: growing up enslaved in the antebellum south. \"by the age of 7, an enslaved child would be expected to be productive,\" potentially helping around the slaveholder's house, watching their children, and learning agricultural or other adult jobs, she said. \"they certainly didn't have a life of leisure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "when he was in congress, brooks was one of 14 members who voted against making juneteenth a national holiday. brooks told reuters that he preferred such a holiday be on a day he considered to be of broader national significance, such as when the emancipation proclamation was signed. in addition, brooks said he also was concerned about the cost of adding a federal holiday without eliminating a current one.\n",
      "in june 2021, brooks co-sponsored a bill called the saving american history act.\n",
      "the bill directs that federal funding be withheld from schools that wish to teach materials based on the new york times' 1619 project, a series of essays about the founding of america that argued the start of african slavery that year wasn't just the country's original sin but \"as important to the american story as 1776,\" the year the united states declared independence. the scholarship of the series has been hailed by some professional historians and criticized by others. the bill didn't make it to the house floor for a vote.\n",
      "\"the federal government,\" the bill reads, \"has a strong interest in promoting an accurate account of the nation's history through public schools and forming young people into knowledgeable and patriotic citizens.\"\n",
      "\"it's always good to know history,\" brooks told reuters.\n",
      "asked about his view on reparations, brooks said the country has already paid one form of restitution, through a civil war-era program proposed by union general william tecumseh sherman.\n",
      "\"you may remember – what was it – 40 acres and a mule?\" brooks asked. \"now i'd have to check my history on how prevalent that was. but some freed slaves were given some amount of reparations, if my memory serves me correctly, and that is the origin of the phrase '40 acres and a mule.'\"\n",

      "had the order been followed, it would have provided black americans assets upon which to build new lives and perhaps pass wealth to subsequent generations.\n",
      "but the program ended quickly, gates wrote. president andrew johnson, the southern sympathizer who succeeded abraham lincoln, \"overturned the order in the fall of 1865\" and returned the land \"to the very people who had declared war on the united states of america.\"\n",
      "the united states has never paid restitution for slavery.\n",
      "'a better nation'\n",
      "some historians and genealogists say there is a valuable reason for white leaders – and other white americans – to explore their links to slavery.\n",
      "many white families may have records that are not in the public domain – documents that could help black americans trace their own ancestries to before 1870, when the formerly enslaved were first recorded by name in the u.s. census. before emancipation, the historical record bears scant detailed traces of individual black americans. not so for white people: old letters, family bibles, or other records left behind by white americans hold the potential to unlock mysteries for the descendants of the 3.9 million black americans who were enslaved at the start of the civil war.\n",

(her suggestion is to upload them to ancestry.com, where others researching the same family can find them. the site requires a subscription.) more and more americans are interested in genealogy, she said, and they think, \"'oh, my gosh, i might be holding on to something in my house that other people need to even make a connection with their ancestors.'\"\n",

      "future of healthbiontech faces first german lawsuit over alleged covid vaccine side effectsby ludwig burger and patricia weissjune 12, 20235:59 am utcupdated  agophoto du logo de biontech prise a marburg, en allemagne. /photo prise le 2 fevrier 2023 a marburg, allemagne/reuters/fabian bimmerhamburg, june 11 (reuters) - biontech (22uay.de) will go to court on monday to defend itself against a lawsuit from a german woman who is seeking damages for alleged side effects of its covid-19 vaccine, the first of potentially hundreds of cases in the country.the woman, exercising her right under german privacy law for her name not to be made public, is suing the german vaccine maker for at least 150,000 euro ($161,500) in damages for bodily harm as well as compensation for unspecified material damage, according to the regional court in hamburg which is hearing the case and law firm rogert & ulbrich, which is representing her.the plaintiff claims she suffered upper-body pain, swollen extremities, fatigue and sleeping disorder due to the vaccine.the first hearing is on monday.tobias ulbrich, a lawyer at rogert & ulbrich, told reuters he aimed to challenge in court the assessment made by european union regulators and german vaccine assessment bodies that the biontech shot has a positive risk-benefit profile.german pharmaceutical law states that makers of drugs or vaccines are only liable to pay damages for side-effects if \"medical science\" shows that their products cause disproportionate harm relative to their benefits or if the label information is wrong.biontech, which holds the marketing authorisation in germany for the shot it developed with pfizer <pfe.n>, said it concluded after careful consideration that the case was without merit.\"the positive benefit-risk profile of comirnaty remains positive and the safety profile has been well characterised,\" the biotech firm said, referring to the vaccine's brand name.it noted about 1.5 billion people had received the shot across the world, including more than 64 million in germany.the european medicines agency (ema) says that biontech's comirnaty, the most commonly used in the western world, is safe to use.in a media briefing last week, the ema reaffirmed the benefit of all covid shots it approved, including biontech's, saying in the first year of the pandemic alone, vaccines were estimated to have helped save almost 20 million lives globally.it has said there is a very small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, two types of heart inflammation, following vaccination with comirnaty, mainly for young males.unexpected side-effects after a drug has regulatory approval are rare. the unprecedented speed at which covid vaccines were developed during the pandemic meant that potential uncommon side-effects may not have been detected as readily as they might have been in traditionally longer trials.ema has said that safety monitoring had not been compromised during the fast-track assessment.the ema had registered almost 1.7 million spontaneous reports of suspected side-effects by may, which translates into about 0.2 for every 100 administered doses.almost 768 million vaccine doses have been administered in the european economic area (eea), which includes the 27 eu member states plus iceland, liechtenstein and norway.the most common temporary side-effects are headache, fever, fatigue and muscle pain.the ema also monitors adverse events or illness after vaccination, and checks for frequencies that surpass normal rates in the non-vaccinated population.liabilityit is not clear who would pay the legal costs or compensation if the plaintiff wins the case.sources have said some of the eu's bulk purchase agreements with vaccine makers, including biontech-pfizer, contained full or partial liability waivers for both legal costs and potential compensation, which could force eu governments to bear some of the costs.like many countries, germany also has a public sector financial support scheme for people who suffer permanent harm from vaccines, known as a no-fault compensation programme, but participation in the programme does not block someone seeking damages separately.the united states has granted manufacturers immunity from liability for covid vaccines that receive regulatory approval.rogert & ulbrich says it has filed about 250 cases for clients seeking damages for alleged side-effects of covid-19 vaccines.another law firm, caesar-preller, says it is representing 100 cases, with both firms saying separately they cover almost all cases in germany between them.a handful of similar cases have been filed in italy.($1 = 0.9289 euros)reporting by ludwig burger and patricia weiss;

      "dear abby: i met my wife in college. we have been married for 40 years and have two adult sons. my wife had a brief affair early in our marriage, but we have long since moved on from that. however, increasingly over the last 15 years, my wife (career homemaker, her choice) has been aggressively making demands in exchange for anything she does for me — i.e., if i don't buy her something, she won't cook dinner, do laundry or have sex. \n",
      "i buy her things all the time, and i give her an allowance, roughly 70% of my take-home pay. some of her demands i simply cannot afford, so i often cook, clean, etc., myself. as a result, we haven't had sex in more than 10 years. \n",
      "two years ago, i met a younger woman. she is also married, although separated. she still shares a home with her husband and their two children. we meet as often as we can and i find her delightful and easy to get along with. lately, she has been saying she wants us to leave our situations and get married. \n",
      "my concern is twofold. first, when my wife gets angry, she threatens to divorce me and take everything i've got, even if it costs her everything as well. she does not bluff. second, my girlfriend is so much younger than i am that i'm concerned that while things are great now, i'll be an elderly man in the not-too-distant future and could be a burden to her. what are your thoughts? — at a crossroads\n",
      "dear \"crossroads\": from what you have written, it appears your marriage has essentially been over for many years. if the only thing keeping you in this unhappy marriage is fear, contact an attorney to discuss what a divorce would cost you financially. whether you should then \"rescue\" this delightful, much younger woman from her unhappy marriage is a separate issue. \n",

      "for service companies that experience a summer slowdown every year, finding ways to keep staff members productive during this time is crucial for maintaining momentum and utilizing resources effectively. while customer or client work may decrease, there are many valuable activities that employees can engage in to make the most of their and the company's time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "here, 18 forbes coaches council members highlight strategies companies can use to ensure teams remain productive during the summertime. from professional development and skills training to brainstorming sessions to make process improvements and enhance internal operations, check out the various avenues service companies can take to help team members focus their efforts in the most beneficial ways when business is slow below.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. focus on free professional development\n",
      "during a summer slowdown, service companies can keep staff productive by focusing on free professional development, process improvement, research, team building, creative projects, networking and free employee well-being initiatives. these activities maximize employee engagement and contribute to long-term growth. - foluso gbadamosi, folusogbadamosi.com\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. evaluate what can be improved\n",
      "i love saying, \"go slow to go fast,\" and summer slowdowns are a great time to invest in personal leadership development. leadership starts with the person. slow seasons are also great for evaluating which systems, tools or processes need to be revamped. lastly, the gift of \"free\" vacation time for employees (whether it is a day or more) from the company goes a long way to rejuvenate staff members for busy times. - melissa deluca, deluca & willow\n",
      "\n",
      "3. reflect on what has gone well and not so well\n",
      "during a summer slowdown, i would focus on three specific things: take time to reflect on what has gone well, what hasn't gone so well and what we can take forward. there is energy that can be taken from reminding ourselves of our success, and learning is invaluable for growth. second, sharpen the saw and focus on personal development. finally, i would look at high-impact, short-burst projects to set us up for success. - ricky muddimer, thinking focus\n",
      "more fromforbes advisorbest travel insurance companiesbyamy daniseeditorbest covid-19 travel insurance plansbyamy daniseeditor\n",
      "4. maximize employees' talent\n",
      "ask employees what they want to contribute in specific areas of the business that will further a certain strategic goal, and then agree on the parameters. this will keep them engaged and excited to be contributing to a valuable, possibly new function for when the business will be back in the swing of things! - cellene hoogenkamp, kokuahub inc\n",
      "\n",
      "5. prepare to cope with future challenges\n",
      "a popular saying advises that \"you have to redo your roof when the weather is nice!\" a business slowdown is a very good time to step back from the daily routines and do a strategic review of activities. here are some questions to answer: \"are we prepared for the next challenges? are we investing enough in people, technologies and innovation to cope with future challenges, both ecological and social?\" - catherine tanneau, activision coaching institute\n",

      "forbes coaches council is an invitation-only community for leading business and career coaches. do i qualify?\n",
      "6. get strategic and build new, faster systems\n",
      "when business is slow, get strategic! any slowdown is a perfect time to invest in building new systems to handle scale and speed. when you have space in the calendar is the time to build templates, processes and business continuity systems, as well as purge inventory and document libraries. slow times are when you lay the foundation to make the faster times smooth! - david taylor-klaus, mcc, cpcc, ctpc, dtk coaching, llc\n",
      "7. brainstorm future services\n",
      "during slowdowns, companies get an incredible opportunity to work on building their team, planning forward, brainstorming future services, reviewing their current processes, testing services for validation and training on new skills that the team may need. this opportunity allows for great growth inside a company if used wisely. - bobbie goheen, synthesis management group\n",
      "8. tie up loose ends, then rest and recharge\n",
      "there is an ebb and flow in life and in business. the key here is to understand that everything is cyclical and change is always around the corner. i encourage my clients to take advantage of the slower times and work on the business by tying up loose ends, getting organized in-house, strategizing on business development and doing some fun team-building activities. rest and recharge for the busy season—it's coming! - cheryl keates, pcc, cheryl keates\n",
      "9. conduct team-building activities\n",
      "a slow period is the perfect time to evaluate the efficiency of the business. looking at department policies, processes and service offerings to determine if any changes are necessary will allow the company to help more customers during the busy season. this is also a great time for team building through volunteer days, cleaning the space, and training and development. - lindsay miller, reverie organizational development specialists\n",
      "10. focus on meeting training goals\n",
      "focusing on meeting training goals for personal and professional development can effectively fill the time during a summer slowdown for service-based companies. this reminds employees they have the power to move the needle in their career trajectories and builds their growth mindset. - ariel mcgrew, tactful disruption®\n",
      "11. cross-train employees\n",
      "one of the strategies that companies can use to keep their staff members productive during the summertime is to cross-train employees. by teaching staff members new skills or having them work in different areas of the business, you can help them stay motivated and prevent boredom or burnout. it is also a great way to keep them engaged and productive when facing a summer slowdown. - paula vidal castelli, paula vidal castelli intl., llc\n",
      "12. hire a development trainer or facilitator\n",
      "a summer slowdown is the best period to use spare time for learning and development so that staff members can sharpen their skills and knowledge or learn new skills to be ready for the peak season. hiring a trainer or facilitator can be a great way to ensure learning and development will not only benefit personal growth, but also business growth. - senem anataca, 180utc\n",
      "13. work on improving internal operations\n",
      "one of my favorite quotes is, \"you do not rise to the level of your goals. you fall to the level of your systems,\" by james clear. if there is downtime, businesses should always be working on improving internal operations, such as processes, it systems and so forth. this will not only likely save the business money, but it also will increase the engagement of your team. - wendy fong, chief gigs\n",
      "14. conduct market and user research\n",
      "here are three ways companies can take advantage of slow times during the summer: 1. hire a training company to train staff on new systems, such as ai technologies. 2. carry out business process improvement initiatives by mapping out, analyzing and improving existing processes. 3. conduct market and user research—review all customer databases as well as competitors' data, and create an improvement action plan for the busy periods. - eno eka, the business analysis school\n",
      "15. innovate and collaborate\n",
      "a summer slowdown allows for space to create. task your staff with working on projects that set their hearts on fire and are of high service to your clients. test out a new offering. connect with your best customers. if you can do this as a team, even better! - amy pocsik, bold moves\n",
      "16. reflect on where you are and start a passion project\n",
      "a common frustration i hear from successful people is that they struggle to make time for strategic thinking. a natural slow point is perfect for reflecting on your direction of travel and on the balance you're striking. how do you really feel about the life you are creating? where do you want to course-correct? then use passion projects as a vehicle for indulging and expanding your capabilities. - duncan skelton, duncan skelton coaching ltd\n",
      "17. create new products and better services\n",
      "use the benefit of downtime to create new products and better services and to provide opportunities for your team to develop new skills. when the clients are ready, your team will also be ready to provide new and better services for your clients! - cindy lamir, impact business coaches\n",
      "18. encourage and allow employees to take more pto\n",
      "companies should be encouraging teams to take paid time off with family and friends during the summer months. research shows that offering sabbaticals is the best way to get people to return to the office refreshed, more grateful and more productive than they were before they left. so, organizations should allow more time off in the summer so that employees come back refreshed and do their best work. - carmelina piedra, careercoachingpro\n",

      "\n",
      "method acting, also known as \"the method,\" based on the early 1900s teachings of russian director konstantin stanislavski and popularized in the united states by director lee strasberg, is a technique in which actors \"use their physical, mental and emotional self in the creation of a character\" to achieve an authentic performance, according to the lee strasberg institute.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "some celebrated method acting performances include strasberg student robert de niro's work in taxi driver and raging bull, for the latter of which he gained 60 pounds to play a retired boxer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the modern understanding of method acting has diverted from stanislavski's original teachings, according to i-d magazine, which reported that method acting is now associated with never breaking character and going to great lengths to fully inhabit characters, which has become popularized by the media.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "some modern method actors who choose to live as their characters onand off-camera have garnered criticism for disruptive on-set behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "jared leto's method techniques have frequently made headlines, including an instance while filming suicide squad (2016), in which he starred as the joker, when he sent co-stars margot robbie and viola davis a live rat and a dead pig, respectively.\n",

      "\n",
      "some non-method actors who have worked with method actors say their process makes the work environment more difficult, like martin freeman, who called his man on the moon co-star jim carrey's method acting process \"self-aggrandizing, selfish\" and \"narcissistic.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "chief critics\n",
      "in conversation with jennifer lopez for the variety studio: actors on actors series, robert pattinson said: \"you only ever see people do the method when they're playing assholes. you never see someone being lovely to everyone while they're really deep in character.\" lopez agreed, stating after years of making movies she often can't wait to go home and let go of her characters. sebastian stan said method acting \"reads like an irresponsible, narcissistic thing. it reads like, 'i'm afraid, and i want to torture everyone else because of it.'\" some have also criticized modern conceptions of method acting for straying from stanislavski's teachings. jon bernthal said he doesn't see the benefit of method acting, but criticized how far the technique has strayed from stanislavski's teachings: \"making everybody call you by your character name and not showering for eight months was not what stanislavski had in mind with the method,\" he told the hollywood reporter last year. will poulter criticized actors using method acting \"as an excuse for inappropriate behavior,\" stating an actor's process shouldn't infringe on other people's work environment. jeremy strong, star of the hbo hit succession, made headlines for comments from co-workers about his intense process on the set (which he does not consider method), which kieran culkin said \"doesn't help me\" and brian cox called \"f——- annoying,\" adding he worries about what it does to him mentally.\n",
      "contra\n",

      "share to facebookshare to twittershare to linkedinwhen i was a kid, the idea of a real-life robot felt foreign. earth was for humans. the jetsons and their robot maid, rosie, existed only on television.\n",
      "\n",
      "now i work in manufacturing and frequently find myself advising companies that, you know that job you can't find the right person to fill? that process you haven't perfected? for that role, perhaps you should consider something a bit more metal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the pushback, and there is plenty, tends to sound a lot alike. it's too expensive. or, it takes too long to set up. or, we just don't have the tech skills to handle that sort of thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "but what if i told you that you don't need any special skills. that there are folks who will do the setup—and even the maintenance—for you. that it may not be as pricey as you think, particularly when you weigh a robot's productivity against a human being— or beings — in the same role.\n",
      "\n",
      "for manufacturers, the fear of robots is real. manufacturers fear their investments won't amount to anything, that they'll be bogged down by maintenance and end up even worse off.\n",
      "but i say fear not, because these days there are business models that cater to smalland medium-sized manufacturers who don't have the in-house staff to manage robots on their own.\n",
      "\n",
      "make technology more affordable with robotics as a service\n",
      "one such model is used by rapid robotics, a san francisco-based company that provides robotics as a service. ceo and co-founder jordan kretchmer saw the high costs falling on manufacturers installing robots. industrial robots could cost anywhere from $40,000 to $500,000, the company says. even with rent-a-robot programs popping up to lower the hardware burden, manufacturers were stuck with implementation costs often soaring into the six-figures.\n",
      "as an alternative, rapid provides both ends of that equation — the physical robot and the implementation, plus ongoing maintenance and reprogramming — at a flat, monthly fee. their low-risk model shields customers from high startup costs and ensures they'll be able to adjust and recalibrate the robot as needs evolve. that happens often when it comes to things like injection mold operations, cnc loading, palletizing, packing and labeling boxes, and other tasks that are otherwise ripe for automation. \"those tasks tend to change over a lot,\" kretchmer says. \"meaning if you automate it with a very specific kind of machine and a very specifically programmed robot, the chances that the operation is going to remain the same for the next two or three years is really, really slim these days.\"\n",
      "more fromforbes advisorbest travel insurance companiesbyamy daniseeditorbest covid-19 travel insurance plansbyamy daniseeditor\n",
      "rapid's service is not necessarily cheap. for a basic robotics arm work cell, it costs $35,000 per year — paid monthly — plus a one-time onboarding fee of an additional $35,000. but kretchmer says those numbers stack up favorably versus the cost of talent, providing companies with positive roi faster than they'd experience with a large initial investment. depending on how many shifts you're running it, the cost of the cobot — or collaborative robot — breaks down to about $6.50 or $7 an hour after year one. the company also offers larger cobots which, at the high end, are priced at $50,000 for a yearly subscription plus $50,000 in one-time onboarding costs. but those machines can replace tasks that usually take two or three people to complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "kretchmer ultimately believes raas can help companies begin to reshore parts of their operation to build resiliency. \"those little bits and bobs that were so easy to outsource, but that are critical components to really important products,\" he says. \"those need to be made locally.\"\n",

      "rapid robotics has created a promising model. but it's not the only way to institute a high-quality cobot into your manufacturing firm.\n",
      "just ask the school lunch-maker innovative food services. founded in 2022, the company grew from a modest restaurant catering business serving 200 or 300 meals a day to a school-lunch focused business that pumps out 9,000 meals daily. ifs has had to scale their operations quickly.\n",
      "along the way, one job on the assembly line was constantly creating problems for ceo thomas lane's staff. it was a position at the end of the line in which an employee would take the meal trays and stack them inside large plastic totes, with a lot of twisting and turning and bending along the way. the role was a back killer, and even rotating various employees in an out of it during each day was causing inordinate amounts of strain. so, one day, ifs reached out to magnet, the nonprofit manufacturing consultancy i run out of cleveland.\n",
      "we worked with a robotics provider to build and deploy a custom cobot that took the place of that difficult, end-of-line job. \"switching over to the cobot, they're able to line up six meals, pick up all six, move them over and drop them down into totes,\" lane says. \"not only has it increased the speed and the efficiency of our line, but also our worker satisfaction. it was a win all the way around.\"\n",
      "ifs would end up purchasing two cobots, one for each of their assembly lines. within 60 days of building, plus a couple more to train staff for regular maintenance, the company was up and running. all in all, lane says the cobots were less expensive than expected, paying for themselves within about 18 months.\n",
      "\"i just encourage other manufacturers to really take that leap if they're on the fence about it,\" lane says.\n",
      "the future of robotics\n",
      "it's difficult to say what's coming next for robotics. business models like the one rapid robotics deploys are attractive in their simplified, all-in-one approach. but it remains to be seen whether manufacturers are willing to trade-out one-time investments — however large they may be — for the subscription model.\n",
      "regardless, there's a lot to be encouraged about when it comes to robotics deployment, from the largest manufacturers to some of the smallest. robotics companies are beginning to realize that the average manufacturer needs help implementing their technology, and they're getting creative and finding implementation partners to provide that expertise. the reward will be sizable: investments in robots contributed 10 percent of the gdp growth in oecd countries from 1993 to 2016, according to one study. and robotics capabilities have only continued to improve.\n",
      "we may be yet to build the world envisioned on the jetsons, but robots have arrived and are here to stay — and that's a good thing for manufacturers.\n",

      "strong brand governance is all about managing how you show up in the world and ensuring it's done in a way that reflects consistency in how customers engage with your brand. this goes for everything—from each logo and asset your brand has to the way your company's brand voice is activated across channels and markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "why is this important? well, it impacts the bottom line. consistent branding helps build awareness and recognition, which is important for success. according to a 2021 statista study, 35% of participants acknowledged that consistency played a part in contributing to at least 20% of their company's revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "take a company like nike, for example. from its iconic \"swoosh\" to its powerful \"just do it\" messaging, nike's branding is instantly recognizable and has inspired long-term loyalty among its fans. that wasn't achieved overnight but was a painstaking process of investing in its brand and showing up consistently across every customer touch point over many decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "historically, managing this process would be very top-down and hierarchical. the traditional model would have one brand manager act as the sole guardian of a company's brand identity, overseeing every customer-facing campaign, product and communication that went through its rigorous approval process before reaching the public.\n",
      "more fromforbes advisorbest travel insurance companiesbyamy daniseeditorbest covid-19 travel insurance plansbyamy daniseeditor\n",
      "though this \"iron fist\" approach offers a comforting sense of control, in reality, it's an illusion. in a world where assets are being created for dozens of channels and markets all around the world, this type of approval model is not easily scalable and cannot move as fast as brand managers need it to. that's why we're increasingly seeing brands adopt a \"lean\" approach—a fresh take on brand governance that boosts collaboration and enthusiasm and makes ownership of brand governance everybody's business.\n",
      "\n",
      "accountability breeds responsibility, but how do you get your people to buy in?\n",
      "when your team members care about your brand and feel pride in it, they are much more likely to go the extra mile and care about using the right assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "at the heart of any successful branding strategy are the people who champion it, which is why it's essential to have brand champions in each department who truly understand your brand's essence and values. these ambassadors must possess a deep understanding of your brand's story and be able to seamlessly articulate its nuances to their colleagues. they are equipped with the knowledge and tools to help their peers find and utilize different brand assets in their daily work.\n",
      "so how do you help people play that pivotal role in your organization? the first thing to prioritize is removing friction. we all know how frustrating it is when you can't find the latest version of an asset, and this is where mistakes can creep in. one way to simplify things is to implement a digital asset management system that centralizes a company's brand assets so that everyone—wherever they sit in the business—knows how to use the right logos, images, videos and collateral in their work. this reduces the need for time-consuming email exchanges, increases efficiency and helps swerve the likelihood of publication errors. and while technology isn't the one-stop-shop answer to all brand compliance challenges, companies can use a range of tools to help manage their brand—from guideline and design tools to entire platforms dedicated to asset management and collaborative working.\n",
      "investing in training whenever you introduce these types of systems is key. providing additional resources such as tutorials from the design department, creative templates for frequently used brand assets, and comprehensive brand guidelines, for both global and local markets, can be invaluable. when everyone has a shared understanding of the brand's importance, employees can see beyond bright colors and flashy logos and feel a deeper investment in their work. this can help them become more engaged and invested in their roles, ultimately fostering a sense of ownership that encourages them to take greater responsibility for the brand's success.\n",
      "breaking free from brand policing: empowering brand guardians for long-term success\n",
      "brand policing is a trend of the past. today's consumers demand transparency and consistency across all platforms, and brands that empower their employees to become brand guardians are the ones that will succeed in the long run.\n",
      "this is underscored by recent findings from a survey by sprout social, which found that \"86% of americans believe transparency from businesses is more important than ever before.\"\n",
      "as digital channels increasingly become the primary means of connecting with customers, taking a top-down approach to brand governance is no longer feasible to holistically maintain a brand's health.\n",
      "this shift toward collective ownership allows for a more organic approach to brand management, enabling individuals to take ownership of their contributions and make informed decisions that align with the brand's values and mission. the brands that successfully trust their people to take this step will be the ones that turn one brand manager into an army of brand guardians.\n",
      "by providing a central hub for teams to collaborate on brand guidelines, assets and projects, everyone in the organization is enabled to have access to the information and tools they need to become brand guardians. and in turn, these brand guardians will be committed to the long-term protection and enhancement of your brand.\n",

      "Title: Gay male couples face more challenges, higher costs to start a family\n",
      "watch nowvideo3:2603:26gay men face more challenges and higher costs to start familysquawk boxbret shuford and stephen hanna knew from early on in their relationship they wanted to raise a child together. but the married couple didn't think a biological child was a possibility.as freelancers in the creative arts, shuford and hanna don't always see steady income, even when working on broadway. the houston-based couple, known as the \"broadway husbands,\" thought having a child with a donor egg and gestational carrier \"seemed like it was something that was only available to people who were very wealthy,\" said shuford, 44.it's a safe assumption that having a child with a surrogate, now most often called a gestational carrier, is cost-prohibitive. while expenses vary widely due to a number of medical and legal factors, \"the average cost of surrogacy in america has gone from $75,000 five years ago, to anywhere between $150,000 and $250,000 today,\" according to dr. brian levine, a reproductive endocrinologist who founded surrogacy matching platform nodal.more from personal finance:how lgbtq+ seniors can tackle their special caregiving challengesfinancial advisor: here are 4 important money tips for parents with young kidsteenagers are in high demand as summer hiring surge gets under wayin the u.s., there are only about 5,000 successful surrogacy journeys per year, nodal estimates.\"that's only about 8% of met need,\" levine said. \"in plain english, 92% of the people that dream of starting or growing or completing a family with surrogacy will not be able to do so in america due to the sheer time and cost constraints that are there today.\"why gay male couples face higher costsalon rivel, left, with his family.courtesy alon rivelalon rivel always wanted to be a father. \"as i grew up, i realized i was gay,\" said rivel, 34. \"so i thought, this will never happen for me. i don't have the money, but i wanted it desperately.\"\"we were shocked when we started to look into [having a biological child] and realized nothing is covered by insurance unless you can prove that you're infertile,\" said rivel, who lives in arlington, massachusetts. he and his husband believed that \"this is complete discrimination on the insurance company's part because we are gay men.\"\"it is not a choice,\" rivel added. \"we were born this way and, thus, we are actually infertile.\"experts say the demand for surrogacy relationships has grown since same-sex marriage became legal in the u.s. in 2015.gay male couples typically face a more expensive journey, as surrogacy or adoption are their primary choices. in contrast, same-sex female couples are often able to carry pregnancies to term on their own, though they may possibly have to pay for donor sperm and fertilization.sadly, we do see in some states that there are laws that discriminate against the lgbtq+ community.betsy campbellchief engagement officer for resolve: the national infertility associationdonor eggs are exponentially more expensive than donor sperm largely because the egg retrieval process is more invasive and complicated. while costs, again, vary wildly, donor eggs and the associated costs can range between $20,000 and $60,000, according to fertility marketplace gostork, while donor sperm can be from as little as several hundred dollars to around $1,000.donor eggs, meanwhile, are only one of many expenses.shuford and hanna's health insurance covered only the tests done on their sperm samples. their remaining expenses, they estimate, ran between $150,000 and $180,000. that included around $40,000 for donor eggs, the medical costs to create, store, test and freeze embryos, medical insurance and out-of-pocket medical costs for their gestational carrier, her compensation, and other expenses.the couple used savings, credit cards and high-interest loans to cover that tab. rivel and his husband's journey to parenthood ultimately cost $220,000.\"we're taking money away from our child's college fund,\" he said. \"we're taking money away from our mortgage.\"\"compared to [many of] our friends, our baseline is $200,000 below where they started,\" rivel added.employer fertility benefits offer limited helpmore employers are starting to offer fertility benefits, often through a specialized fertility benefits manager such as kindbody, carrot, progyny or maven. in 2022, 40% of u.s. employers offered some type of fertility coverage, up from 30% in 2020, according to the international foundation of employee benefit plans.fertility iq, which keeps a workplace index of employer fertility benefits, found the average amount of fertility coverage in 2021 was $36,000 per lifetime, flat from the year before.but while more companies are offering fertility benefits, many of these packages are limited when it comes to covering what's needed to build families using non-traditional methods. almost two-thirds, 63%, of lgbtq+ people plan to use assisted reproductive technology, foster care or adoption to become parents, according to a survey by family equality.yet fewer than half of employers offering fertility benefits provided any benefits for adoption, and only about 10% provided benefits related to surrogacy, according to a 2021 survey from resolve: the national infertility association and health-care consultancy mercer. and state laws requiring employers of a certain size to offer fertility benefits often leave out coverage for third-party reproduction such as a gestational carrier or the purchase of donor eggs or donor sperm.\"i honestly believe that employers don't realize there is a gap in their benefits. and they often don't know this until an employee points that out,\" said betsy campbell, chief engagement officer for resolve.she said many employers she speaks to have \"the best intentions\" but don't understand how gestational surrogacy works or how family building benefits fall short.will porteous, 39, became a father through gestational surrogacy before joining maven as its chief growth officer. he and his husband tabulated their parenthood path cost at close to $175,000. \"no employer in the entire country that i'm aware of offers anything greater than $75,000 a year, and so that only covers a portion.\" will porteous, right, with his husband, doug, and their son, walter.courtesy will porteousbut porteous, who lives in wynnewood, pennsylvania, said full coverage isn't necessarily what lgbtq+ couples want to see. \"the expectation is to have equitable support to your other co-workers and seeing that your employer cares about that journey,\" he said.that employer support, porteous said, \"really means a lot and it shows that you as an employer care about your employee, regardless of how they're going to build their family.\"fertility benefits can help recruit, retain talentwhile fertility benefits manager progyny's first clients were largely west coast \"silicon valley-type\" businesses, according to ceo pete anevski, it now works with employers in 40 industries.\"there's a flywheel effect happening,\" he said, with more companies realizing benefits need to include family-building coverage \"to be competitive, to attract and retain talent in what is still a tight labor market, an inflationary economy, even with concerns around a looming recession.\" fertility benefits manager carrot said it has around 800 corporate clients and 80% of those offer their employees a benefit for surrogacy. \"we have seen an increase in surrogacy claims year over year at about 250%,\" said ceo tammy sun. offering these types of benefits can be key factors for a company when job candidates are making decisions about employment, said taryn branca, chief revenue officer at kindbody.\"i can't tell you how many of our clients will call us, we will get on the phone with potential candidates that they're recruiting, or we will provide information to support that recruit coming there because they are asking for very specific information before they'll accept the offer: if they have surrogacy benefits, if they have donor benefits,\" she said.more than half of respondents in a new progyny survey of lgbtq+ community members said they are actively looking to build their families. of that population, 79% would consider leaving their current job for one that offers better fertility and family-building benefits, and 80% would consider taking a second job to receive those benefits.\"this is not a 'nice to have,' this is a 'need to have' benefit,\" anevski said.rivel's husband is an early employee at massachusetts-based beam therapeutics. at rivel's insistence, he asked his human resources department to look into including surrogacy benefits. eventually, the company added a surrogacy reimbursement benefit, which at the time rivel and his husband used it was worth $10,000. while $10,000 was a small dent in the couple's $220,000 surrogacy journey, rivel said it's better than nothing. \"it's really admirable that they have it,\" he said. \"i think it's a really smart benefit for recruiting more people.\"adoption also comes with high costs, risksadoption is certainly another family-building option. \"it's not for everyone ... it's not without its costs, and the laws vary by state,\" resolve's campbell said. \"sadly, we do see in some states that there are laws that discriminate against the lgbtq+ community, so that's definitely a consideration.\"the average nonfoster-system adoption costs between $25,000 and $60,000, according to the child welfare information gateway. as with surrogacy relationships, the adopting parents cover related expenses for all parties, from medical to legal, plus living expenses if a match is made in advance of a birth. and, of course, there are no guarantees.shuford and hanna decided adoption wasn't a path for them. \"there's a lot of risks involved that we weren't willing to take,\" hanna said. \"we had heard of stories involving birth mothers changing their minds, and children having birth defects that without [genetic embryo testing] weren't known.\"'it was totally worth it'stephen hanna, left, with his husband, bret shuford, and their son, maverick.courtesy bret shuford and stephen hannalike many gestational carrier stories, shuford and hanna's was far from easy or straightforward.their first carrier dropped out of the process shortly before the embryo transfer was scheduled to take place but well after contracts had been signed and medical assessments and travel had occurred. the covid-19 pandemic delayed the process with their second gestational carrier; then, after the first embryo transfer, the pregnancy ended in a devastating miscarriage. the second embryo transfer worked, and their surrogate gave birth to their son, maverick, in 2022.\"so many times, we felt very excluded,\" shuford said. \"we want to be able to have a family and raise our child and have that child be biologically related to us, and we have a right to do that, and we have a right to feel seen and validated in that process.\"but for shuford, \"in the end, it was totally worth it.\"\"i mean, maverick is amazing,\" he added. \"and we're so lucky to have a healthy baby and also having someone like crystal, our surrogate who carried our child.\"\"i don't know that i've ever experienced that kind of love in my life,\" shuford said. \"so it's really a powerful experience.\" \n",

      "Title: Beauty and tech company Oddity, which runs Il Makiage, files to go public\n",
      "oddity il makiagecoutesy: odditybeauty and tech company oddity, which runs the il makiage and spoiled child brands, filed to go public friday as the once-frozen ipo market warms up. the israel-based company plans to trade on the nasdaq using the ticker odd. the company didn't immediately disclose how the offering would be priced in regulatory filings and declined comment when asked when the numbers would be released.\"the number of shares to be offered and the price range for the proposed offering have not yet been determined. the offering is subject to market conditions, and there can be no assurance as to whether or when the offering may be completed, or as to the actual size or terms of the offering,\" oddity said in a press release.launched in 2018 by brother and sister duo oran holtzman and shiran holtzman-erel, oddity uses data and ai to develop brands and make tailored product recommendations for customers.the business is seeking to disrupt a market long dominated by legacy retailers by replacing the in-store experience with product recommendations driven by ai and data. at the heart of its business model is its proprietary technology — including tech developed by a former israeli defense official — and the billions of data points it has collected from its millions of users.in the three months that ended march 31, the company saw $165.65 million in revenue, up from $90.41 million in the year-ago period. it reported a net income of $19.59 million, or $5.34 a share, compared with $3.01 million, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier.numbers revealed in its regulatory filing show the direct-to-consumer retailer has been profitable on an annual basis since at least 2020.in fiscal 2022, oddity brought in $324.52 million in sales and saw a net income of $21.73 million, or $5.94 a share. in the year prior, the retailer saw $222.56 million in revenue and a net income of $13.92 million, or $4.01 a share.in 2020, it saw $110.64 million in sales and a net income of $11.71 million, or $3.45 a share.by comparison, when e.l.f. beauty filed to go public in august 2016, its profits and sales were lower than oddity's. e.l.f., a multibrand beauty company, saw $144.94 million in sales in fiscal 2014 and a net loss of $2.88 million. the following year, it saw $191.41 million in sales and a net income of $4.36 million. in fiscal 2016, it brought in $229.57 million in sales and a net income of $5.31 million. since going public, e.l.f.'s sales and profits have climbed. during its most recent fiscal year, which ended march 31, it saw $578.84 million in sales and a net income of $61.53 million. as a direct-to-consumer retailer, oddity is seeing the high margins that come along with the strategy. in the three months that ended march 31, its gross margins were 71%, up 4 percentage points from 67% in the year-ago period. its annual margins have slipped each year since 2020 as the company has made acquisitions and invested in growing the business.in 2020, oddity had an annual gross margin of 70%, and in 2021, it dropped 1 percentage point to 69%. in 2022, the retailer's annual gross margin was 67%, down 2 percentage points from the year-ago period.as of march 31, the company had more than 4 million active customers, which it defines as a unique customer account that made at least one purchase in the preceding 12-month period.\"we bring visitors to our website, turn visitors into users by asking questions and learning about them, and then leverage the data we have across the platform to convert them into paying customers,\" a regulatory filing says.oddity has launched internationally, and sales from those markets accounted for about 26% and 27% of its net revenue in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. as of friday, oddity has launched in the u.s., canada, u.k., continental europe and australia. it noted it has plans to keep growing that footprint.the company plans to use proceeds from the ipo to develop and launch new brands. it will also use the funds for working capital, other general corporate purposes and potentially for acquisitions and other investments.during an interview earlier this year, the company's global chief financial officer, lindsay drucker mann, a former goldman sachs executive, told cnbc that oddity is making money and growing — even against a tough macroeconomic environment that has proven increasingly risky for purely digital retailers. on average, oddity's gross sales have doubled each year since 2018, the company has said.in spoiled child's first year on the market, the new brand brought in $48 million in gross sales, which does not include returns. in a regulatory filing, holtzman, the company's ceo and co-founder, said the company recruits from the israeli defense forces' best technology units. technologists comprise over 40% of its global head count.\"as industry outsiders, we saw many shortcomings in the status quo approach. the empires that incumbents had built over decades had not evolved with the times, resulting in a significant lag in online adoption,\" holtzman wrote in a founder's letter enclosed in a securities filing.\"their underinvestment in technology left the category behind the digital curve, despite a consumer who is inherently primed to buy online — spending significant time on social media for beauty content and rapidly shifting dollars online in other categories.\"(l to r): dr. david zhang, oddity's new head of bioengineering and the chief science officer and co-founder of revela; oddity co-founder shiran holtzman-erel; oddity co-founder and ceo oran holtzman; dr. evan zhou, oddity's new chief science officer and revela's co-founder and ceo.alberto vasari for odditybeyond developing new products and brands, oddity is also trying to make beauty products more effective, the company has said. in late april, it announced it was investing more than $100 million to acquire biotech startup revela and open a u.s.-based lab.the merger brought to oddity a team of scientists tasked with creating brand-new molecules, using artificial intelligence, that can be used in its cosmetics brands and future lines.in 2021, oddity acquired voyage81, a deep tech ai-based computational imaging startup founded in 2019 by niv price, the former head of research and development for one of the israeli defense forces' elite technological units, along with dr. boaz arad, dr. rafi gidron and omer shwartz.the technology is capable of mapping and analyzing skin and hair features, detecting facial blood flows, and creating melanin and hemoglobin maps using a regular smartphone camera.the filing comes after a year and a half of a drought in the initial public offering market, which is just beginning to open up and show signs of green shoots. earlier this month, mediterranean restaurant chain cava went public, and its shares soared as much as 117% in its market debut. \"[in 2022] investors didn't want to go anywhere near ipos but now that they're making money again, and with issuers seeing that they can achieve close to decent valuations, i think that's bringing the people back into the market,\" said matt kennedy, a senior ipo market strategist for renaissance capital.\"the consumer sector does lend itself to these periods where investors can see a business model that they understand, a business that they might be familiar with and also one that is typically profitable or near profitable, preferably that has growth.\" \n",

      "file photo: the port bow railing of the titanic lies in 12,600 feet of water about 400 miles east of nova scotia as photographed as part of a joint scientific and recovery expedition sponsored by the discovery channel and rms titantic.stringer | file photorescuers in a remote area of the atlantic ocean raced against time tuesday to find a missing submersible before the oxygen supply runs out for five people who were on a mission to document the wreckage of the titanic.despite an international rescue effort, u.s. coast guard officials said the search covering 10,000 square miles (26,000 square kilometers) had turned up no signs of the lost sub known as the titan, but they planned to continue looking.authorities reported the carbon-fiber vessel overdue sunday night, setting off the search in waters about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of st. john's, newfoundland. aboard were a pilot, renowned british adventurer hamish harding, two members of an iconic pakistani business family and a titanic expert.the submersible had a 96-hour oxygen supply when it put to sea at roughly 6 a.m. sunday, according to david concannon, an adviser to oceangate expeditions, which oversaw the mission.that means the oxygen supply could run out thursday morning.cbs news journalist david pogue, who traveled to titanic aboard the titan last year, said the vehicle uses two communication systems: text messages that go back and forth to a surface ship and safety pings that are emitted every 15 minutes to indicate that the sub is still working.both of those systems stopped about an hour and 45 minutes after the titan submerged.\"there are only two things that could mean. either they lost all power or the ship developed a hull breach and it imploded instantly. both of those are devastatingly hopeless,\" pogue told cbc on tuesday.the submersible had seven backup systems to return to the surface, including sandbags and lead pipes that drop off and an inflatable balloon. one system is designed to work even if everyone aboard is unconscious, pogue said.experts said the rescuers face steep challenges.us coast gurad captain jamie frederick speaks during a press conference about the search efforts for the submersible that went missing near the wreck of the titanic, at coast guard base in boston, massachusetts, on june 20, 2023.joseph prezioso | afp | getty imagesalistair greig, a professor of marine engineering at university college london, said submersibles typically have a drop weight, which is \"a mass they can release in the case of an emergency to bring them up to the surface using buoyancy.\"\"if there was a power failure and/or communication failure, this might have happened, and the submersible would then be bobbing about on the surface waiting to be found,\" greig said.another scenario is a leak in the pressure hull, in which case the prognosis is not good, he said.\"if it has gone down to the seabed and can't get back up under its own power, options are very limited,\" greig said. \"while the submersible might still be intact, if it is beyond the continental shelf, there are very few vessels that can get that deep, and certainly not divers.\"even if they could go that deep, he doubts rescuers could attach to the submersible.by tuesday morning, an area totaling 10,000 square miles had been searched, the u.s. coast guard tweeted.the canadian research icebreaker polar prince, which was supporting the titan, was to continue conducting surface searches with help from a canadian boeing p-8 poseidon reconnaissance aircraft, the coast guard said on twitter. two u.s. lockheed c-130 hercules aircraft also conducted overflights.the canadian military dropped sonar buoys to listen for any possible sounds from the titan.concannon, who said he was supposed to be on the dive but could not go, said officials were also working to get a remotely operated vehicle that can dive to a depth of 3.7 miles (6 kilometers) to the site as soon as possible.oceangate's expeditions to the titanic wreck site include archaeologists and marine biologists. the company also brings people who pay to come along, known as \"mission specialists.\" they take turns operating sonar equipment and performing other tasks in the submersible.the coast guard said monday that the titan carried a pilot and four \"mission specialists.\" however, oceangate's website suggests that the fifth person may be a so-called \"content expert\" who guides the paying customers.authorities have yet to formally identify those on board, though some names have been confirmed, including oceangate ceo stockton rush, who, according to the company, was serving as a member of the crew.rush told the associated press in june 2021 that the titan's technology was \"very cutting edge\" and was developed with the help of nasa and aerospace manufacturers.\"this is the only submersible – crewed submersible – that's made of carbon fiber and titanium,\" rush said, calling it the \"largest carbon fiber structure that we know of,\" with 5-inch-thick carbon fiber and 3.25-inch-thick titanium.a us coast guard vessel sits in port in boston harbor across from the us coast guard station boston in boston, massachusetts, on june 19, 2023.joseph prezioso | afp | getty imagesharding, who lives in dubai in the united arab emirates, was one of the mission specialists, according to action aviation, a company where harding serves as chairman.harding is a billionaire adventurer who holds three guinness world records, including the longest duration at full ocean depth by a crewed vessel. in march 2021, he and ocean explorer victor vescovo descended to the lowest depth of the mariana trench. in june 2022, he went into space on blue origin's new shepard rocket.also on board were pakistani nationals shahzada dawood and his son suleman, according to a family statement. the dawoods belong to one of pakistan's most prominent families. their eponymous firm invests across the country in agriculture, industries and the health sector.shahzada dawood also is on the board of trustees for the california-based seti institute that searches for extraterrestrial intelligence.french explorer and titanic expert paul-henry nargeolet was also aboard, according to david gallo, a senior adviser for strategic initiatives and special projects at rms titanic. gallo identified nargeolet, a friend who has led multiple expeditions to the titanic, on tuesday during an interview with cnn.greg stone, a longtime ocean scientist based in california and a friend of rush, called the lost submersible \"a fundamentally new submarine design\" that showed great promise for future research. unlike its predecessors, the titan was not spherical in shape.\"stockton was a risk taker. he was smart ... he had a vision. he wanted to push things forward,\" stone said.the expedition was oceangate's third annual voyage to chronicle the deterioration of titanic, which struck an iceberg and sank in 1912, killing all but about 700 of the roughly 2,200 passengers and crew. since the wreckage's discovery in 1985, it has been slowly succumbing to metal-eating bacteria.oceangate's website described the \"mission support fee\" for the 2023 expedition as $250,000 a person.recalling his own trip aboard the titan, pogue said the vessel got turned around looking for the titanic.\"there's no gps underwater, so the surface ship is supposed to guide the sub to the shipwreck by sending text messages,\" pogue said in a segment aired on \"cbs sunday morning.\" \"but on this dive, communications somehow broke down. the sub never found the wreck.\" \n",

      "a passageway near the bank of england (boe) in the city of london, u.k., on thursday, march 18, 2021.hollie adams | bloomberg | getty imageslondon — the bank of england on thursday surprised markets with a 50 basis point hike to interest rates, its 13th consecutive increase as policymakers grapple with persistently high inflation.the monetary policy committee voted 7-2 in favor of the half percentage point increase, which takes the bank's base rate to 5%. the move defied market expectations, which had priced in around a 60% chance of a 25 basis point hike.sterling slipped against the dollar after the announcement while yields on u.k. government bonds — known as gilts — also retreated slightly. the yield on the 10-year gilt was down by around 4 basis points. yields move inversely to prices.fresh data on wednesday showed annual u.k. consumer price inflation was 8.7% in may, unchanged from the previous month, cementing market expectations that the mpc would opt for another hike. economists also upped their expectations for further monetary tightening in the future.watch nowvideo3:3103:31bank of england surprises as it hikes rates to 5%squawk box europemost worryingly for the central bank, core inflation — which excludes volatile energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices — was 7.1% year on year in may, up from 6.8% in april and marking its highest rate since march 1992.\"there has been significant upside news in recent data that indicates more persistence in the inflation process, against the background of a tight labour market and continued resilience in demand,\" the mpc said in its summary thursday.\"the mpc will continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures in the economy as a whole, including the tightness of labour market conditions and the behaviour of wage growth and services price inflation. if there were to be evidence of more persistent pressures, then further tightening in monetary policy would be required.\"policymakers are walking a tightrope as they attempt to tighten monetary policy sufficiently to quell inflationary pressures without triggering a full-scale mortgage crisis and recession.the mpc said that the high number of fixed-rate mortgages means that the full impact of the increase in the bank rate so far \"will not be felt for some time.\"since the end of 2021, the bank has hiked its main rate from 0.1% to 5%.\"the economy is doing better than expected, but inflation is still too high and we've got to deal with it,\" bank of england governor andrew bailey said in a statement thursday.\"we know this is hard — many people with mortgages or loans will be understandably worried about what this means for them. but if we don't raise rates now, it could be worse later.\"a 'hawkish super-hike'although the market had partially priced in the larger increase, several analysts suggested that the size of the majority voting in favor of it implied a sense of urgency among mpc members.joseph little, global chief strategist at hsbc asset management, said the \"hawkish super-hike\" comes at a critical juncture for the economy and signals policymakers' desire to \"get ahead of the curve.\"\"the u.k. finds itself in the worst position of major western economies. a cost of living crisis, brought about by rising energy and food prices, has been amplified by structural labour shortages, and has now metastasised into ratcheting wages,\" little said. \"inflation pressures show more persistency and more momentum than other western economies, and that forces the bank into a hawkish corner. today's statement has increased concerns of a much-higher terminal policy rate, perhaps as high as 6%.\"although all developed economies endured a similar post-covid pandemic deluge of inflationary pressures, u.k. headline inflation is decelerating at a much slower rate, while the core component is significantly higher than all other g10 nations and still accelerating.huw davies, investment manager at jupiter asset management, said thursday's move from the mpc was \"a tacit admission that they have been behind the curve in their hiking policy,\" and the rate rise represents \"an attempt to regain the initiative and their credibility.\"\"the key problem is that u.k. real rates have consistently been negative despite the tightening cycle. it feels like the boe will have to inflict more pain on u.k. households to achieve a return to a controlled level of inflation more in line with their inflation target,\" davies said. \n",

      "my relationship with wellness is more complicated than running into a guy i ghosted at an office party. i began my journey in 2017 as a lot of people do: dressed in lululemon and sipping green juice on my way to a yoga class. (i had chosen trap classes because i was much more comfortable hearing \"mouth full of golds\" during child's pose than risking stepping on a white woman's yoga mat.) soon, wellness became a capitalistic pursuit i held near. i loved grabbing a blue spirulina smoothie while out on a run — but only dressed in head-to-toe nike gear. lulu was for the gym and yoga. i became obsessed with rings, namely, closing the ones on my apple watch. \n",
      "by 2020, after spending thousands of dollars on this journey without seeing any measurable improvement in my mental health — which people do experience from wellness efforts — i began to interrogate why i expected this effort to cure my anxiety and depression. i was sidelined by the coronavirus pandemic and, like many others, began to question what actually mattered to me. still, i did yoga, strength trained, cycled, and meditated at home to keep myself mentally afloat during the pandemic and during the antiracism protests over the murder of george floyd, an immensely triggering moment for black folks. having a routine was helpful until it wasn't. \n",
      "by 2022, i was experiencing weekly panic attacks that slowly increased to i-don't-know-how-many-days a week. i wasn't sleeping or moving much farther than from my bed to the couch. when i was eating, i wasn't choosing nutritious foods. i'd run out of motivation to care for myself — and all of it felt like it shouldn't be happening to me because i should be tougher.  \n",
      "mainstream wellness was, to lean further into cliches, a band-aid on a bullet wound. i was actively pursuing better mental and physical health, a key piece of a wellness journey, but i wasn't taking the time to establish what felt good to me. i was trying to fit into the trendiness of wellness, and i desperately wanted the freedom it proclaimed i could have if i bought enough stuff. nowadays, i define wellness as, \"doing what feels good and aligns with what i believe i need in this moment.\"\n",
      "my burnout story is a quintessential narrative among black women. many of us have been raised to be \"strong\" despite the systemic factors that make such an ideal impossible to uphold. the strong black woman trope demands that we swallow our pain for the greater good of others, and it comes with grave psychological consequences. it can make us more susceptible to depression, anxiety, and feelings of isolation. for some black women, we rarely forgive ourselves for our mistakes and relentlessly seek to meet others' expectations. this is more harrowing when we consider that stress compounds. besides causing headaches, chest pain, fatigue, and stomach issues, heightened stress levels can make sleeping impossible. your breathing can quicken. you could develop high blood pressure, a weakened immune system, anxiety, depression, type 2 diabetes, or memory loss — adverse health outcomes that black people are more likely to experience. \n",
      "the systemic conditions that prevent black women from being able to take proper care of ourselves is one of our nation's most significant health injustices. and to add insult to our spiritual injury, wellness practices, which can be a useful tool to fight poor mental health, are presented to us through a eurocentric, capitalist lens, encouraging us to spend money many of us don't have on products we don't need to care for ourselves. \n",
      "i discussed these conditions and the role wellness plays in navigating them with deja love, the ceo of the black women's wellness agency. love's agency supports black women who are stressed, burnt out, and overwhelmed by connecting them to black women wellness providers. this could be a yoga teacher, meditation or life coach, personal trainer, or any non-clinical wellness service that helps manage stress. \n",
      "\"we have to go deeper because the world in which we're living in, it's not sustainable for us to keep at this pace,\" love says. \"i really view this as a fierce urgency, as life or death. when black birthing persons are dying at three times the rates of white folks, that's a crisis. we are dying, across the board, at higher rates. this is why it's so important.\" \n",
      "this interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. \n",
      "explain your personal approach to wellness. is it more spiritual? or is it more political? \n",
      "for black women, our wellness is infinite. that it is not a $200 yoga mat or yoga pants. since, especially in the mainstream context of the united states — which is incredibly racist with white supremacist undertones — wellness is generally capitalistic. it's about the doing, and the purchasing. \n",
      "infinite wellness is knowing that maybe wellness for me in one moment is sitting in silence, sensory deprivation, not on social, not logged in, but sitting, connecting to breath, connecting to the divine spirit that guides us, whatever folks identify with. in the context of america, wellness is rest. it's challenging a toxic grind culture that tells us we need to constantly produce, that we're not enough, that we're not doing enough. i'm guided by tricia hersey and her work. she leads the nap ministry, and her book rest is resistance has really shifted my paradigm and informs a lot of what i view as wellness.\n",
      "what are some of those white supremacist undertones to wellness? \n",
      "it's really this notion of, \"i have to do something. i have to purchase something. i have to buy something. i have to keep performing.\" and that can look like, \"i need to buy the expensive mask. i need to buy expensive face serums. i need to go to the gym classes.\" it's still a perpetuation of grind culture and hyper-productivity. whereas the black woman's wellness agency and i challenge that and say, \"black women, you are enough by just being!\" it seems so simple, but the brilliance is in the simplicity of being — not doing. wellness is shifting our minds away from what we have been indoctrinated with, such as: \"i have to be a certain weight, i have to look a certain way, i have to have this.\" no. we have to be on the path of unlearning.\n",
      "those are some of the undertones. it's about this aesthetic, and that's what we get. but wellness is not an aesthetic. wellness is being connected to our breath, our bodies, and calming the mental fluctuations that happen constantly. \n",
      "this multibillion-dollar wellness industry that says you have to drink this or take this supplement or be in this intricate yoga posture just creates more work. \n",
      "why isn't wellness binary for black women? i was looking on your website, and i saw that. i think i know what that means, but i'm very, very intrigued.\n",
      "it's not binary because we, as black women, are so robust. we have had to be. we've had to be the heads of households, to be cooks and cleaners, to raise children and make sure the finances are handled — we're constantly wearing so many hats. our healing and our wellness are not going to be boxed in. it can't be, because we have to do so much. \n",
      "black women are the largest demographic of advanced degree holders and business owners post-2020. we're doing so much, and that's why we're proponents of wellness being whatever it is you need. \n",
      "if wellness is saying, \"i'm just really tired, and i don't need to push through,\" then that's wellness. if wellness is saying, \"my family is expecting me to do something, and i say i can't do that because i need to uphold my boundaries, and i can't keep pouring from this empty cup,\" then that's wellness. that's the journey that i'm still on. we're all still on it. \n",
      "it has to be full-spectrum and incredibly inclusive. it has to counter the mainstream approach to wellness — the skinny white woman in lululemon doing an intricate yoga posture. that is not true wellness; that is a capitalistic approach that we have been fed, and we have to keep pushing back because that image may not serve us. now, we are not a monolith, so maybe that image serves some black women. i know for many, though, that it does not.\n",
      "one thing that i think most black women can all relate to is the pressure to fit into these spaces, whether it's work or a yoga studio, where you're the only black person there, and people are looking at you crazy. so when we reclaim and reframe wellness — meaning we stop looking at it through this billion-dollar lens — how do we reconnect with our power? \n",
      "it's multifaceted. it will take many different approaches. one of them is going for a walk and doing a walking meditation, not having your airpods in, just listening to the sounds of nature so you can get out of your head and connect with the many thoughts that are going to come into your mind. i don't want to demonize social media. it's an amazing tool that connects us, but part of reclaiming is having healthy sabbaticals from social [media]. \n",
      "i'm also a proponent of therapy. therapy helps us be introspective. \n",
      "another thing that has helped me is being able to be free. business ownership has allowed me to feel free. i've had an 18-year career in many business sectors, and within all of those sectors, you become indoctrinated, and your truth gets stifled by the dominant group. and even those who look like me can fall into assimilation and respectability. i speak unapologetically, and many people do not connect, and that's fine. i've had to make peace with the fact that i may not get all the business contracts, or i may not gross the revenue that i want. but i can sleep at night knowing that i am speaking for black women, that i am challenging inequities, the status quo, and a society that perpetuates it.\n",
      "you pointed out that when black women really start taking care of ourselves, prioritizing our needs, and start centering our well-being, we lose people. it's always been very interesting to me that when a black woman starts thinking about her well-being versus how she can be in service to everyone else, people start dropping off. \n",
      "earlier today, when i was on my walk, i was thinking about when we're on journeys of evolution. i don't want to be the same deja i was three years ago, a year ago. i want to be evolving, and learning, and there are folks that will not be there on that journey ... it's hard sometimes. it's always the folks you don't expect, the people who were always there. and that just hurts harder. part of that evolution is releasing that attachment. and the folks that connect to me will find me. i will build a new community. \n",
      "it's like my granny used to say, \"everybody can't come.\" speaking of her — a black woman who absolutely prioritized her well-being after raising three generations of her family — how does wellness help black women thrive?\n",
      "it helps us because we are able to get reconnected with self. when i'm putting on my public health hat, our life expectancy is reduced in this white supremacist, very racist society. from medical racism in health care, housing, education, transportation — every facet that we intersect with has a huge impact on our outcome. every facet of being in this country challenges us. wellness helps us get back to our center when all of these forces that create the inequities we live in challenge us.\n",
      "sometimes we will question ourselves. we forget the confidence, the power, the self-esteem, the self-efficacy because we have been metaphorically beaten down by all of these systems.\n",
      "we even have to combat the complicity of folks in our own communities and other white-adjacent folks of color. i know that's a provocative notion. black people and other folks of color can uphold white supremacy because we're all stewed in the same society. so people get surprised, for instance, that a black physician can perpetuate harm to their black patients. they have been trained in racist medical schools, so they can perpetuate what they have been taught. that's why wellness is so important. wellness is whatever a black woman needs. we know what we need for our healing, to feel grounded, to feel at peace, to feel centered. that is crucial as we navigate this society that we operate in.\n",
      "how does taking care of ourselves challenge hustle culture? sometimes this strikes me as a conundrum. we're trying to get out of this capitalistic dynamic of wellness, but we live in a capitalistic society, and we have to survive. and sometimes, for certain wellness practices, you have to buy something. it feels very sticky sometimes to see taking care of yourself as a challenge to capitalism when we live in a society where it's so deeply entrenched.\n",
      "it's so important because grind culture is insidious. we are not even aware of the hold that grind culture has on us. that's why stepping back transforms. \n",
      "again, i'm not immune from it. that's why i'm so intentional with my unlearning, even as a business owner, challenging myself to not just push through. i'll say: \"deja, you've been up for how many hours? you've been in how many back-to-back meetings? go out, take a walk, do a guided meditation, go do some yoga, just do something!\" \n",
      "i want to see a world where all black women, and i use that term inclusively, are well. where we're not burnt out, where we're not overwhelmed, where we're not stressed, where employers don't undervalue our contribution — they're not even paying us the full dollar! we're getting what? sixty-seven cents on the dollar? and working twice as hard to prove ourselves. that is the encapsulation of grind culture and being unwell. \n",

      "\n",
      "first, advertising dollars go up and down with the economy. we often only know a few months out what our advertising revenue will be, which makes it hard to plan ahead.\n",

      "out of the millions of fungal species in the world, only a few hundred can make people sick. coccidioides is one of them — and it lives in desert dust. microscopic spores are kicked up when the ground is disturbed; if inhaled, they can cause an infection known as valley fever. most people recover without ever knowing they had it, but others will experience far more intense symptoms, ranging from pneumonia to meningitis. coccidioides is also really good at eating ... meat. \n",
      "fortunately, this fungus is typically only found in the southwestern us, parts of mexico, and central and south america — and cases are rare. but unfortunately, that range is expanding quickly. scientists are racing to understand exactly why, because even though this fungus has existed for millennia, there are still tons of unanswered questions about how it lives both in the desert and in people.\n",

      "for a show incredibly concerned with the reality of restaurant kitchens — the heat, the stress, the yelling, the emotions — the bear is ultimately a fantasy, and that's all the more clear in season two. \n",
      "the first season, which found fiercely talented young chef carmen \"carmy\" berzatto (jeremy allen white) in his hometown of chicago running his recently deceased brother michael's (jon bernthal) sandwich shop, was sweaty, dirty, shouty, and as helen rosner wrote for the new yorker, something of a fairy tale. thanks to the gorgeously frenetic directing style that matches the show's substance, we followed along as carmy navigated everything from balancing a severely mismanaged budget to teaching a fine-dining mentality to his skeptical crew (including his \"cousin\" richie (ebon moss-bachrach)). after those trials, however, the season ended with a deus ex machina: before his suicide, michael had hidden hundreds of thousands of dollars in tomato cans, saving the shop and allowing his skilled younger brother to open the high-end restaurant of his dreams. \n",
      "in its second season, the bear — also the name of the coming restaurant — is ready to tackle that challenge, and the show has unfurled into something bigger, better, more satisfying than its intricate collaboration of style and substance. if the first season poses the question of what an ambitious, dedicated, and inspired team can do with enough money, the second season has a touching answer: nurture their talent.\n",
      "early on, sydney (ayo edebiri), carmy's second in command, is in a rut. opening the restaurant that they want to open is all she's ever dreamed of. but the freedom comes with the duress of delivering a menu that's as good as they want it to be. for both chefs, but especially sydney, that means food that will earn a michelin star. she blows carmy's palate with food that's too salty; he throws it up into a paper towel. she tries again. he spits it out again. closer but not there. they need a reset, he declares. then he tells her to just go eat. she follows orders, making her way through chicago's best restaurants — starting with a breakfast sandwich at kasama (tagalog for togetherness) and visiting the city's lauded eateries like avec, margie's candies, pizza lobo, and publican quality meats) — before gathering her wits and attempting a ravioli dish.\n",

      "\n",
      "she ends up hating what she made, but not before exemplifying the show's sly second-season credo: a compassionate daydream where nothing is more important than nourishing the staff's gifts. from marcus's (lionel boyce) trip to copenhagen to richie's entry into the world of staging to the joy in tina (liza colon-zayas)'s smile when syd makes her her sous chef, the bear never wavers from its conviction that talent and inspiration are precious. while there might be stress about exactly how much to spend on plates or how to pass the fire safety test, there's never a question about if it's worth it to make these people better at what they love to do. \n",
      "approaching the idea of (troubled) genius isn't foreign territory to the bear. the show has tackled it before, mainly in the context of how skill and aptitude go hand in hand with upward trajectory. carmy is so gifted that he finds freedom from his messy family life to work at one of the best restaurants in the country. his brilliance gives him escape, however briefly. carmy's talent is too big for the sandwich shop he inherits, and season one is about whether or not he can learn how to harness it into this mode of success.\n",
      "but this season, the show proves that talent is not strictly an individual endeavor. to grow as a person takes a community; a team effort. from sydney to marcus to tina to the famed chef terry (olivia colman in a glorious cameo), the throughline is that all these remarkable people need or needed people in their lives to nurture their gifts.\n",
      "that's evident in the episode \"honeydew,\" when carmy and sydney want marcus to up his pastry chef game. despite the increasing financial strain the restaurant is facing, they decide, without question, to send him on a trip to hone his desserts. the destination is copenhagen, where he'll sleep on the same houseboat and feed the invisible cat that carmy once did, and train under icy and talented pastry chef luca (will poulter), one of carmy's cohort. \n",
      "luca is firm but shows marcus how to create wildly punctilious desserts, like a scoop of ice cream so temperamental it needs to be caressed a certain way and a shiso gelee that ultimately ends up in a \"minty snickers bar.\" marcus's knack for picking up technique impresses luca enough that he tells marcus a story about a chef (who may or may not be carmy) so good that he forced luca into a bittersweet revelation. on the one hand, luca realized he'd never be the best, and on the other, this unnamed chef somehow unburdened him from the pressure he was putting on himself, allowing him to be the best he could be. luca found community in competition and realized that talent isn't a zero-sum game where someone else's talent negates your own.\n",
      "there's room for everyone; talent inspires and fosters success, and marcus is part of that circle.\n",
      "similarly, the team sends tina to culinary school. again, cost doesn't even come into question. she thrives, relishing the opportunity to improve her skills. in the second season, initially guarded tina's hunger for self-improvement is one of her defining characteristics, as is her fierce loyalty to carmy and syd. it makes the small moment in episode five, when carmy lets her bring his knife to culinary school, feel momentous. with carmy's confidence and tools, tina filets her culinary fish confidently, a determined look in her eye as the blade flips through the flesh. the cut is so good her instructor congratulates her. \n",

      "the best episode this season has richie staging a week at the best restaurant in the world in \"forks.\" richie begins by polishing forks. he hates every second of it, convinced this is all some exquisite and unusual punishment. it isn't until someone points out to richie that being able to change someone's day is truly wonderful, that it finally begins to click that he's watching extreme talent sharpened with extreme discipline.\n",
      "when he sees how the restaurant's servers communicate like soldiers speaking in secret code, detailing diners' stories, lives, eating habits, and allergies, he lights up. watching jess (sarah ramos) expedite, like a conductor telling their horn section to blow, thrills him. the once reluctant fork-shiner is able to identify the restaurant's plethora of sauces in a blind taste test.\n",
      "he's high on success, on feeling like he's part of this team. richie wants to be the best version of himself. richie wants to work at this restaurant. but that's not how it all works.\n",
      "at the end of richie's week, he runs into chef terry (colman) cleaning mushrooms, a seemingly menial task. after peeling a couple of mushrooms himself, he takes a moment to apologize, thanking her for doing carmy a favor. she says that it actually wasn't a favor or a punishment, but that carmy told terry that he believes in richie and that he's naturally good at front of house. he doesn't let her see it, but it warms his heart. she also tells him that it's never too late to start over, that she crashed and burned and needed a reset too. \n",
      "a sign in her kitchen reads: \"every second counts.\"\n",
      "it's an homage from her to her late father, and a message that richie will never forget. terry's story also ties back, again, to the idea of how greatness needs a family or a community to survive. without her father, without her staff, without the people who helped her, she wouldn't be the most successful chef in the game.\n",
      "this idea that people who recognize talent should foster it and help it grow goes both ways. sydney, marcus, tina, richie, and even chef terry are lucky they've found someone who believes in them. if you want to grow as a person and hone your craft and what you love, you need to find someone who believes in you. it isn't a coincidence that carmy's biological family is portrayed as an acidic, toxic hindrance to his career, and that the one he's created for his team — via his network of chefs — is the literal opposite.\n",
      "of course, this is all a fantasy. \n",
      "bosses don't usually send their employees to scandinavia to nourish their souls and ignite their inspiration. a fantasy where our jobs make us better and recognize our brilliance and diligence is even more appealing as we're living in a reality suffering from burnout and the threat of ai replacement. the restaurant world — as the bear is keen to show us — is a different universe.  and even then, the bear is more of an exceptional exception and not the norm. \n",
      "there's no guarantee that these characters will make good on their talent or that their talent will somehow lead to the success of carmy's restaurant. that's ultimately up to the fickleness of a cruel industry. but i can't help but hope that it does. \n",

      "      most news outlets make their money through advertising or subscriptions. but when it comes to what we're trying to do at vox, there are a couple of big issues with relying on ads and subscriptions to keep the lights on.\n",

      "it's important that we have several ways we make money, just like it's important for you to have a diversified retirement portfolio to weather the ups and downs of the stock market. that's why, even though advertising is still our biggest source of revenue, we also seek grants and reader support.

      "fine particulate matter, known as pm2.5 (the 2.5 microns describes its size, 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair) can embed in the cells of the lung and the bloodstream, aggravating inflammation, asthma, heart disease, and mental health. and ozone causes similar damage. in the stratosphere, ozone blocks ultraviolet radiation from the sun, but at ground level it can cause shortness of breath and damage to respiratory tissue. \n",
      "both pollutants can affect the entire body in all stages of life: young and old, and even the developing fetus. they come from sources as varied as the tailpipe of a truck, your neighbor's barbecue, coal plant, or an incinerator. pm2.5 is capable of traveling thousands of miles across the world on the wind — taking, for instance, about five days to reach the us from china. \n",

      "what is the air quality index?\n",
      "the air quality index, set by the environmental protection agency, is your guide to how bad the air quality is outdoors. the data that goes into the air quality index comes from 5,000 air monitors across the country, including local, state, tribal, and federal reporting. \n",
      "there are actually two aqis for air quality, one for particulate matter and one for ozone, but when you see just one aqi, you're looking at whatever pollutant is the higher of the two. \n",
      "you can find the latest aqi on the epa's airnow website or by downloading its airnow app. weather apps are often using propriety data from a company called breezometer to determine aqi and forecasts. these numbers are based on epa monitoring but may not be identical to the epa's aqi, though they should be in the same ballpark. outside the us, air pollution monitoring can vary widely depending on the country, so aqis reported around the world may also be pulling from a mix of computer modeling and satellite data.\n",
      "there are some important drawbacks to the aqi. it tries to distill a lot of information into one datapoint, and it depends on air monitors often placed near cities and not close to industrial polluters. since air pollution can vary widely even over short distances — think a busy highway versus a quiet, tree-lined road — the air could be worse if you're near a pollution source. communities of color are systematically exposed to more pollution from industrial sources and transportation, and the aqi doesn't do a good job capturing that disparity. \n",

      "people have different sensitivities to air pollutants, just as people can have different temperatures they're comfortable at. they can even be more uncomfortable with one type of pollutant than another.\n",
      "but the epa breaks out its recommendations for a general population group and a sensitive population. the sensitive group is actually quite large. if you have asthma or copd, you fall in this category, but so do young children (under age 5), older adults (over 65), and pregnant people. \n",
      "\"the younger the child is, the faster their breathing, and so pound for pound, they are breathing more air pollution,\" said lisa patel, a stanford professor of pediatrics and an executive director of the medical society consortium on climate and health. \"we use 5 as a cut-off for particular vulnerabilities because age 0-5 is a period of really rapid lung growth. and so exposure to those toxins so early is particularly concerning, but it's also concerning across the entire spectrum of ages.\"\n",

      "what are the six level of air quality? and when should i be concerned?\n",
      "the epa breaks the air quality index into a few categories with different recommendations. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "green (0–50): the air is safe to breathe.\n",
      "\n",
      "yellow (51–100): the air quality is considered moderate, except for the most sensitive groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "orange (101–150): sensitive groups should reduce heavy exertion outside or take more breaks, and people with asthma and heart disease should watch for symptoms. the rest of the population may be fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "red (151–200): the air is unhealthy for everyone. sensitive groups should avoid being active outdoors, while everyone else should reduce their time outdoors.\n",
      "\n",
      "purple (201–300): the air is very unhealthy for everyone. everyone should consider moving their activities inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "maroon (301 and above): this is the highest level — hazardous — and anyone can be at risk. everyone should avoid physical activity outdoors, and if you're sensitive, you should remain indoors.\n",
      "\n",
      "doctors and public health experts urge people to monitor any symptoms as pollution levels climb, especially once the aqi is in the orange and red range. \n",
      "the symptoms to watch can vary. a surefire sign to take it easy (limiting activity outdoors and potentially seeking medical help) is shortness of breath. coughing, discomfort, and tightness of the chest can all signal issues with breathing. \n",
      "other symptoms could be less obvious, throat irritation, fatigue, a stuffy nose or a headache. an epa expert explained she feels a side stitch when exercising on a bad air day. \n",
      "in infants, patel suggests to look out for grunting noises, bobbing heads, and using chest muscles to breathe as warning signs. kids who have asthma should have an asthma action plan set with a health provider on using an inhaler.\n",
      "it's important to pay attention to these symptoms in both adults and children while regularly checking the aqi level at which you start to feel discomfort. starting this now will help you in the future when you need to decide what precautions to take and when.\n",
      "what are the precautions i should take outdoors, and when should i take action? \n",
      "the aqi is most confusing when it falls into the yellow, orange, and red ranges. \n",
      "if you are sensitive to air pollution, then you want to reduce your exercise and heavy exertion outside once the aqi hits orange. the entire population should start taking precautions when it is in the red territory. you might even want to reconsider spending extensive time outside at these higher levels, and don an n95 or kn95 mask if you do need to be outside (cloth masks will not protect you from pm2.5).\n",
      "it helps to think about reduction in terms of dosage. you can cut your time outside, your exertion level, or both. if you reduce a 30 minute walk to 15 minutes, you're cutting your exposure to the pollution by half. if you sit on your porch instead of going for a walk or run, you're also cutting down how much pollution you inhale.\n",
      "when is air pollution at its worse?\n",
      "the time of year, and even the time of day, can matter immensely for air quality. \n",
      "ozone is typically at its worst in warmer months, between april and october in the us. it needs sunlight to trigger its chemical reactions, so late afternoons and early evenings can be smoggier than the mornings. emissions that come from the tailpipes of cars and burning fossil fuels interact to form ozone that can build up to dangerous concentrations depending on geography and weather patterns. \n",
      "particulate matter's worst months are usually peak wildfire season, so late summer and fall. again, though, there are no strict rules here. wildfires are no longer contained to predictable seasons due largely to climate change, as the east coast experienced when canadian wildfires caused smoggy extremes in early june. other sources of pm2.5 include barbecues and fireworks, making july fourth and the days that follow worse for air quality. \n",
      "tracey holloway, an atmospheric scientist at the university of wisconsin-madison who works with nasa, also explained that, unlike ozone, pm2.5 \"comes in different flavors.\" she explained, \"there are some situations where pm2.5 is highest at night because it's trapped [an inversion where the ground is cooler], and there's some situations where pm2.5 is highest in the middle of the day because it's cooked up by the sun.\"\n",
      "though experts focus mostly on the two main pollutants of concern in air pollution, pm2.5 and ozone, there are other substances that can hitch a ride with this pollution. patel, the pediatrician, said wildfire smoke is especially toxic. burning trees can release more mercury in the air because of how the pollutant has settled on surfaces. and when fires hit houses and towns, they burn up plastics and petrochemicals, releasing more carcinogenic and metallic substances into the atmosphere.\n",

      "\n",
      "since you're getting a hefty dose of air pollution from the outdoors, it's even more important not to expose yourself unnecessarily inside. former director of the center for climate, health, and the global environment at harvard t.h. chan school of public health and pediatrician aaron bernstein said people do this in ways they don't realize. they might idle their cars in attached garages, or use fragranced and ozone-forming products, or run woodor gas-burning stoves and fireplaces that pollute indoor air.\n",
      "what can my community do to reduce air pollution?\n",
      "the no. 1 action we can take for better air is addressing the root cause, not just the symptoms. after all, not everyone has control over their outdoor activities, and some communities and outdoor workers face astronomically higher risk from pollution than others. white americans contribute more to air pollution through their consumption of goods and services, yet black and hispanic americans tend to live in neighborhoods with lower air quality. \n",
      "one of the challenges in tackling climate change is that the carbon we're releasing now will stick around in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. that's fortunately not the case with particulate matter and ozone. they settle in a matter of days, so air can clear almost immediately once we address the sources of pollution. the world experienced how fast the air can improve when road and air travel came to sudden standstill early in the covid-19 pandemic. \n",
      "\"a lot of air pollution comes from controllable sources,\" holloway said. \"when we implement changes to our transportation, industries, energy systems, and roadways, all of those can immediately improve our air quality. certainly, we can't just make a policy change and have wildfires go away. but for many other sources of air pollution, there are a lot of available technologies to make the air cleaner.\"\n",
      "despite worsening wildfires, air quality has on the whole grown cleaner, especially within the united states over the last 40 years, as states have reduced major industrial sources of smog. environmental regulations have worked as intended to clean up the worst polluters. \n",
      "\"we have already made huge improvements in having cleaner vehicles and trucks, cleaner power plants, and cleaner industrial facilities,\" said holloway. \"and these have been deliberate choices that we've made.\" holloway believes \"this isn't a hopeless situation\" as long as society moves to tackling the sources of the problem.\n",

      "technically speaking, the summer solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the tropic of cancer, or 23.5 degrees north latitude. this will occur at exactly 10:57 am eastern wednesday. if you're a fan of sunlight, wearing shorts, eating ice cream, and enjoying all summer has to offer, this is likely a big day for you.\n",

      "1) why do we have a summer solstice, anyway?\n",
      "the summer and winter solstices, the seasons, and the changing length of daylight hours throughout the year are all due to one fact: earth spins on a tilted axis. \n",
      "the tilt — possibly caused by a massive object hitting earth billions of years ago — means that for half the year, the north pole is pointed toward the sun (as in the picture below). for the other half of the year, the south pole gets more light. \n",

      "2) how many hours of sunlight will i get on the 21st?\n",
      "that depends on where you live. the farther north you are, the more sunlight you'll see during the solstice. alaska-based climatologist brian brettschneider created this terrific guide (click to see some charts): the northernmost latitudes will see an entire 24 hours of sunlight, while most of the us will see anywhere between 14 and 16 hours.\n",

      "\n",
      "here's another cool way to visualize the extreme of the summer solstice. in 2013, a resident of alberta, canada — several hundred miles south of fairbanks but still in a high latitude — took this pinhole camera photograph of the sun's path throughout the year and shared it with the astronomy website earthsky. you can see the dramatic change in the arc of the sun from december to june. (you can easily make a similar image at home. all you need is a can, photo paper, some tape, and a pin. instructions here.)\n",

      "this is a 6 month pinhole photo taken from solstice to solstice, in medicine hat, alberta, canada. we are one of the sunniest cities in canada, and this shows it nicely.posted by ian hennes on saturday, december 21, 2013\n",

      "3) is the solstice the latest sunset of the year?\n",
      "not necessarily. just because june 21 is the longest day of the year for the northern hemisphere doesn't mean every location has its earliest sunrise or latest sunset on that day.\n",
      "if you live in washington, dc, the latest sunsets will start the day after the solstice, the 22nd. if you like sleeping in, that's arguably the most exciting day of the summer. timeanddate.com can tell you when the latest sunset will occur in your area. \n",
      "4) is the solstice really the first day of summer?\n",
      "well, depends: are you asking a meteorologist or an astronomer?\n",
      "meteorologically speaking, summer is defined as the hottest three months of the year, winter is the coldest three months, and the in-between months are spring and fall.\n",
      "here's how noaa breaks it down:\n",
      "meteorological spring includes march, april, and may; meteorological summer includes june, july, and august; meteorological fall includes september, october, and november; and meteorological winter includes december, january, and february.\n",
      "so by this meteorological definition, summer has already started. but astronomically speaking, yes, summer begins when the sun is directly over the tropic of cancer, which is on the solstice. \n",
      "5) do i need to wear sunscreen? \n",
      "yes, you should wear sunscreen in the intense summer sun. though, as vox's julia belluz has reported, the research on whether sunscreen actually helps prevent the more aggressive form of skin cancer is lacking. as she writes:\n",
      "\n",
      "the us preventive services task force summed up the evidence on the health effects of sunscreen use ... [and] found that sunscreen reduced the incidence of squamous cell cancer, but that it had no effect on basal cell cancer. what's more, \"there are no direct data about the effect of sunscreen on melanoma incidence.\"\n",
      "still, research is always evolving and newer studies are emerging that show sunscreen can curb melanoma risk, such as this long-term trial from australia.\n",
      "\n",
      "that said, it does definitely help prevent sunburn, which is unpleasant. for more on the science of sunscreen, read belluz's explainer.\n",
      "6) are there solstices and equinoxes on other planets? \n",
      "yes! all the planets in our solar system rotate on a tilted axis and therefore have seasons. some of these tilts are minor (like mercury, which is tilted at 2.11 degrees). but others are more like earth (23.5 degrees) or are even more extreme (uranus is tilted 98 degrees!). \n",
      "below, see a beautiful composite image of saturn on its equinox captured by the cassini spacecraft (rip) in 2009. the gas giant is tilted 27 degrees relative to the sun, and equinoxes on the planet are less frequent than on earth. saturn only sees an equinox about once every 15 years (because it takes saturn 29 years to complete one orbit around the sun).\n",

      "in 2018, nasa launched the parker solar probe, a spacecraft designed to come within 4 million miles of the surface of the sun (much closer than any spacecraft has been before). the goal is to study the sun's atmosphere, weather, and magnetism and figure out the mystery of why the sun's corona (its atmosphere) is much hotter than its surface. still, even several million miles away, the probe will have to withstand temperatures of 2,500 degrees fahrenheit.\n",

      "      most news outlets make their money through advertising or subscriptions. but when it comes to what we're trying to do at vox, there are a couple of big issues with relying on ads and subscriptions to keep the lights on.\n",

      "first, advertising dollars go up and down with the economy. we often only know a few months out what our advertising revenue will be, which makes it hard to plan ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "second, we're not in the subscriptions business. vox is here to help everyone understand the complex issues shaping the world — not just the people who can afford to pay for a subscription. we believe that's an important part of building a more equal society. and we can't do that if we have a paywall. \n",
      "\n",
      "it's important that we have several ways we make money, just like it's important for you to have a diversified retirement portfolio to weather the ups and downs of the stock market. that's why, even though advertising is still our biggest source of revenue, we also seek grants and reader support. (and no matter how our work is funded, we have strict guidelines on editorial independence.)\n",

      "kimberly teehee, pictured in front of the cherokee national history museum in talequah, oklahoma, in april 2023, would be the first cherokee delegate to congress.\n",
      "katrina ward for the 19th\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "this story was originally published by the 19th, an independent nonprofit newsroom reporting at the intersection of gender, politics, and policy. sign up for their daily newsletter.\n",
      "tahlequah, ok — kim teehee can trace her ancestors on a scattered tour of the south — in georgia, up through the carolinas, and into tennessee. if a single place can divide a family's story in two, then for teehee's it might be blythe ferry, a crossing point for the tennessee river at the northwest corner of the cherokees' ancestral homeland, now tennessee. \n",
      "\"they moved across the water, basically symbolic of saying goodbye to the homelands forever,\" teehee said.  \n",
      "she recalled from her office in eastern oklahoma her ancestors' brutal and often deadly journey, the end point of what became known as the trail of tears — ꭰꭹꮅᏹ ꮧꭸꮵᏹꮔꮝꮤꮕꭲ — for thousands of cherokee people forcibly removed from their home. \n",
      "flanked by a traditional buffalo grass doll and sipping a diet coke, teehee traces the long thread of us federal action that shaped the next chapter of her story: federal action brought her family to a nearby town that has been marked by poverty and poor health. a federal program to assimilate native american children took her parents to a boarding school, and another sought to urbanize them with work in chicago. federal dollars would fund the preschool she attended and the hospital where her parents built careers.\n",
      "cherokee people and their tribal government, teehee believes, should have always had a seat at the table where these decisions were made: the very treaty that saw her ancestors forced off their lands almost 200 years ago also promised cherokee people a non-voting delegate seat in the us house. now, the cherokee nation and teehee — who was appointed to the job by the tribe's leaders — are mounting an aggressive campaign to see that promise fulfilled.\n",
      "the cherokee nation's efforts to sit teehee in the house have bipartisan support, but it's not immediately clear when or how congressional leaders will take up the issue in earnest. if she gets this seat, with spots on key panels and the power to speak on the house floor, teehee hopes to help shape the next chapter of federal policy to benefit tribal governments and the people they serve. that includes addressing the epidemic of violence against native women, saving the cherokee language from extinction, and protecting funding for health care and housing.\n",
      "\"as a foundational matter in my life story, it's important to appreciate that so much of federal indian law and policy in this country has so directly impacted my family, personal story, and my journey,\" teehee said. \"i didn't see it as a young girl, but much later i could appreciate it all.\" \n",
      "the cherokee nation is the country's most populous tribe, with 450,000 citizens. teehee's seat in congress would mark the beginning of a new kind of relationship between the federal government and the cherokee nation, along with the tribal governments of the 573 other federally recognized tribes. that the first delegate from the cherokee nation would be a woman in a men-dominated chamber would also send a public message about the tribe's values. \n",
      "\"we are matrilineal people. it informs a lot about how we care for our families and empower all generations of women to lead,\" taralee montgomery, a senior policy adviser for the cherokee nation told the 19th. \"the fact that the first delegate to be seated is a woman — that's obvious to cherokee culture.\"\n",
      "montgomery, 31, has worked alongside teehee for six years and described her as an \"absolute force.\" montgomery had just unveiled a new room designed to accommodate breastfeeding parents who work at the cherokee nation's offices in the tribe's capital of tahlequah or visit the building for government services, part of the tribe's efforts to make its government more family-friendly. she credited teehee with empowering her to pursue the project. \"she means so much to young people like me,\" montgomery added.  \n",
      "montgomery said that until recently, many cherokee people didn't know about the provision of the 1835 treaty of new echota promising a cherokee delegate. since the campaign to seat teehee kicked off last fall, interest in seeing the treaty fulfilled has been building among cherokee people.\n",
      "\"the thing about kim teehee is that she will never meet a challenge that she won't take on and conquer,\" montgomery said. \"that tells you a lot about her role as a delegate.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "the durbin feeling language center, which opened last year, is housed in what used to be an old casino on the southern end of tahlequah. the immersive space, used to teach the cherokee language to children and adults, exudes joy, but also urgency. in 2019, cherokee people declared their language to be under a state of emergency, headed for extinction. \n",
      "of about 400,000 cherokee people living in the united states, a survey found that just over 2,000 can speak cherokee fluently. most of those speakers are over the age of 40, and every year, there are fewer. just 50 families are estimated to speak cherokee at home. \n",
      "teehee doesn't speak much cherokee, though her parents both grew up speaking it almost exclusively at home in the land allotments assigned to their families by the federal government near stilwell, oklahoma, about 30 minutes outside tahlequah. on the grounds of the salem baptist church in stilwell, rows of headstones mark the graves of teehee's family members.  \n",
      "why teehee is not fluent in cherokee can be traced back to federal policy — more specifically, a program that sought to urbanize native americans with the promise of work opportunities far from their reservations. the federal dollars that helped fund the durbin feeling language center are the beginning of the effort to repair the harms from that policy, and it's personal for teehee. \n",
      "teehee's parents met at sequoyah high school, which at the time was a us bureau of indian affairs boarding school. they weren't prohibited from speaking cherokee — a rule at many such schools — but it wasn't useful in communicating with students who hailed from different tribes from across the region. \n",
      "teehee's dad eventually dropped out to enroll in a federal work relocation program that took him to chicago, where teehee was born and spent the first decade of her life. \n",
      "\"the idea was to relocate you to find new opportunities. its intent, though, from congress, was to assimilate you into mainstream society,\" teehee said. \"there's a saying that has its origins in the indian boarding school era, which is, 'kill the indian, save the man.'\"\n",
      "chicago became one of the largest hubs of relocated indigenous americans in the united states. teehee grew up understanding she was cherokee, but the opportunity for work in chicago afforded to her parents meant the loss of formative years in her own cherokee community. through his job, teehee's dad was able to complete his high school diploma, which helped pave the way for a trade job back home in oklahoma, where the family yearned to be.\n",
      "many of those at the durbin feeling language center have similar family stories: they didn't grow up speaking the language at home but want to learn now; they want their own children to grow up fluent. \n",
      "kristen thomas, who leads a program that pairs native cherokee speakers with hopeful students, notes that the building itself is an immersive experience in the cherokee language. every sign and every book inside the 52,000-square-foot facility — from the label on the fire extinguisher to a storybook about the solar system — is written in cherokee to serve its preschool through eighth grade language immersion school and its adult apprentice program. when its day care center opens later this year, the babies too will hear only cherokee. \n",
      "the school's main purpose is to create new cherokee speakers, but it is also a hub to foster pride in cherokee culture. inside the school's gym, there is a stack of wooden sticks with loops on one end used to play stickball, a sport played by several north american indigenous tribes that was the precursor to lacrosse. another space holds a demonstration kitchen to preserve traditional cherokee recipes, like ꮢꭹ & ꮷꮺꮵ, a dish made up of wild onions prepared with eggs and animal fat.\n",
      "the center was made possible by a combination of cherokee nation funds and federal dollars. earlier this year, president joe biden signed a law that funds a federal survey of both native language use and the funding needs of language revitalization efforts. it shares its namesake with the center: durbin feeling was the cherokee linguist who helped add the cherokee syllabary to word-processing technology.\n",
      "thomas said that federal support for cherokee language revitalization efforts is crucial, given that language is \"the lens through which we view the world.\" she described teehee as an obvious choice to represent cherokee people in congress and urged house lawmakers to take action. \n",
      "\"there's that we deserve it, and that we've been promised this,\" thomas said. \"but even without that, this is such an obvious placement and way to strengthen the partnership with indian country.\" \n",
      "teehee said the effort to protect native american languages would be one of her priorities as the seated cherokee delegate to congress. the cherokee nation believes that federal support to protect the language would help directly address its own damage to native american language and culture. \n",
      "\"i always say i'm a product of federal indian policy and relocation, getting us to another state where acculturation was the goal,\" teehee said. \"but i'm also a product of its failure because the program highly underestimated the attachments that indians have toward their communities and our families.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "while in college, teehee joined the cherokee nation's government office to work as an intern under wilma mankiller, the first woman elected as principal chief of the cherokee nation.\n",
      "mankiller, who died in 2010, became teehee's longtime mentor. teehee described mankiller as an exacting boss who nevertheless taught her to be patient when listening to people's struggles and to welcome them with empathy. \n",
      "in 1985, mankiller had become just the third chief elected to the role since cherokee people regained the power to elect their own chiefs in the 1970s. during her tenure, mankiller reshaped the tribe's relationship with the federal government to protect its sovereignty, and focused on health care and women's leadership.\n",
      "mankiller, in a speech at emory university, told a story about an encounter between cherokee people and a united states treaty negotiation team. the us cadre was made up of men, prompting the cherokees to ask, \"where are your women?\" \n",
      "teehee had been set on going to medical school, but mankiller urged her to attend law school. afterward, teehee felt pulled to a career advocating for the power and sovereignty of the cherokee nation and its people. she decided washington, dc, was the place to do it after hearing one of the tribe's lobbyists describe quashing what they considered anti-indian legislation in congress.\n",
      "in 2009, after a decade working on native american issues in dc, teehee would be tapped for her highest-profile job to date as the nation's first-ever senior policy adviser for native american affairs under the administration of president barack obama. in that role, she pushed for legislation that would strengthen accountability for people who commit crimes against native american women.\n",
      "more than four in five american indian and alaska native women — 84.3 percent — have experienced violence in their lifetime; more than half have experienced sexual violence, according to a 2016 federal study. murder is the third leading cause of death for native american women. \n",
      "advocates have long criticized federal and state law enforcement agencies for not doing enough to respond to missing person reports and reports of violence related to native american women and girls.\n",
      "the national indigenous women's resource center blames the high incidence of violence against indigenous women on the erosion of tribal sovereignty and a complicated justice system facing victims and their families that has allowed perpetrators to move on without facing accountability. \n",
      "\"in the 1970s and '80s, as tribes are starting to grow more economically, and creating more jobs, and creating resorts and casinos, and hotels and golf courses, that's inviting more non-indians on the reservation. when you don't have criminal jurisdiction over that non-indian, that's an enormous gap,\" teehee said. \n",
      "\"and then when you combine that with the fact that, you know, probably about half of native american women are married to non-native spouses, you leave an environment that's vulnerable for the rates that we have of domestic violence in indian country.\" \n",
      "a tool to combat those astounding rates of violence was included in the 2013 reauthorization of the violence against women act. it gave tribal governments power to prosecute non-indigenous people who commit domestic violence or dating violence against indigenous women in indian country.\n",
      "teehee said the measure found a receptive ear in congress in part thanks to her years of relationship-building and education on native american issues with lawmakers and congressional staff.\n",
      "after a stint at the democratic national committee helping the party navigate its relationship with native american tribes and advocacy groups, teehee pivoted to congress in 1998, becoming a senior adviser and the sole staffer for the first native american caucus in the house. \n",
      "the caucus worked to educate members on indian issues, \"as well as try to kill anti-indian proposals,\" teehee said. often, positions that weren't favorable to native american tribes came from lack of information about how proposals would impact them.\n",
      "\"i felt that that was my job to fill gaps,\" teehee said. \"if you don't have time to get to know an issue, you can't write about it for your boss, i will do it. and i don't need credit for it. i'll give you a letter. i'll give you a memo. i'll set up meetings for you. i'll give you backgrounders.\" \n",
      "when the time came for negotiations surrounding the violence against women act and the provisions dealing with tribal jurisdiction in 2012, teehee said, the administration had a congress that was really informed and supportive of issues impacting native american people. \n",
      "\"if we don't do it now, we're going to lose that learning curve,\" teehee told the administration at the time. \n",
      "while she's not a seated delegate in congress, teehee has continued advocating on behalf of the cherokee nation in congress and before the white house. last year, biden signed a reauthorization of the same law that expanded the list of crimes over which tribal governments have jurisdiction to include sexual violence, sex trafficking, and stalking. \n",
      "it's ongoing work. teehee said that the list of issues impacting tribal governments is long and the list of champions in congress is ever-fluctuating. the next battle for tribal governments will be to secure funding for their most basic operations. about 90 percent of all federal funding that flows to tribal governments is discretionary and subject to constant reauthorization. teehee has been advocating for that funding to become a permanent expenditure out of reach of politicking or a government shutdown. \n",
      "\"that's education, that's housing, that's food,\" teehee said. \n",
      "\n",
      "set back from a busy commercial street by a lush green lawn in the heart of tahlequah sits an ornate two-story brick building. this structure replaced a wooden one that burned down during the civil war and was finished in 1869 — 40 years after the forced relocation of cherokee people to this land — and became the capitol of the cherokee nation. in the 1900s, when oklahoma became a state and the federal government sought to dissolve the tribal governments, the cherokee legislative body lost its power and the building became the property of the local county government. cherokee people wouldn't elect their own chief for another 70 years. \n",
      "one question that comes up often in discussions about seating a cherokee nation delegate in congress is why it took nearly 200 years for the tribal government to name someone to the post and move to formally seat them in washington. \n",
      "\"when we get to our new homeland, we are simply trying to survive and rebuild a great society,\" said chuck hoskin, the principal chief of the cherokee nation. like the old capitol, now the cherokee history museum, cherokee people would go through periods of destruction and disempowerment for the next 150 years. \n",
      "in the 1970s, when cherokee people elected their first principal chief and the federal government gave the tribe more financial autonomy, hoskin said a period of rebuilding began that led to the moment the tribe finds itself in now — where it has the political connections and resources to demand its seat in congress. \n",
      "hoskin, who was reelected to the job this year, oversees the tribe's government.\n",
      "those efforts appeared on the brink of success at the end of last year, following a months-long public campaign to pressure the united states to fulfill its treaty obligation, including intense lobbying of congressional leaders and dozens of interviews with the press. the campaign gained momentum from a congressional hearing in november, where lawmakers of both parties acknowledged the treaty and expressed support for exploring different avenues to seat teehee. support rose to the highest ranks when then-house speaker nancy pelosi committed to finding a \"path\" to welcome a cherokee nation delegate into the house.\n",
      "republican rep. tom cole of oklahoma, who now chairs the panel handling this issue, the rules committee, called teehee \"a very good friend\" during the hearing. cole's office did not respond to a request for comment about when his committee may take up the issue again.\n",
      "an aide to rep. jim mcgovern, the highest-ranking democrat on the panel, who spearheaded the november hearing, said mcgovern continues to believe that a cherokee nation delegate should be seated in the house and reaffirmed the lawmaker's commitment to advocating for the issue.\n",
      "the aide said mcgovern was frustrated that the issue didn't advance in the 117th congress.\n",
      "into december, teehee and the cherokee nation's leaders held onto hope that democratic leaders would act on the issue before their time in the majority ran out. they did not. \n",
      "the house's new gop majority meant the cherokee nation's delegate campaign had to start over in the work of educating lawmakers. they also needed to address outstanding concerns, which boil down to four critical questions.\n",
      "the first and most consequential is whether seating the cherokee delegate can be done with a simple house resolution, or if the process will require approval from the senate and the president — a lengthier and more politically involved process.\n",
      "second, some lawmakers have wondered whether congress should have a delegate who is appointed. the house's delegates representing us territories are elected, but teehee was appointed by the cherokee nation's tribal government. (the cherokee nation says it's within its sovereign rights to decide how it picks its own representative.)\n",
      "the third is whether sitting teehee would give double representation in congress to cherokee people, who are already technically represented by whoever their local representative is. \n",
      "lastly, congress would also need to decide how to handle the claims made by other cherokee bands to the delegate seat. on the side of tahlequah's main artery, a large ad on a bright electronic billboard shows a cherokee woman alongside a plea to congress to seat a cherokee delegate. but the woman is not kim teehee — it's tori holland of the united keetoowah band of cherokee indians of oklahoma, which has its own treaty claim to a delegate seat in congress. there may be another. \n",
      "all are questions that cherokee nation lawyers and congress's research arm have studied.\n",
      "\"it's an enormous undertaking to educate again,\" teehee said. \"i feel like i'm back at being that staffer that used to research, write memos, write letters, write colloquies, figure out how to message to d's and to r's. you know, i'm back in that space again. \"\n",
      "just outside the lawn of the cherokee history museum in a busy part of tahlequah is a sitting area and art installation lush with lavender and ornamental grass. tall murals feature the work of traci rabbit, a cherokee artist who says her work tries to capture the essence of the native american woman: \"from the proud lift of her chin to the strands of hair caught in the wind, she appears to weather all storms.\" \n",
      "it's sunny, the bright colors of the murals are popping, and the women in them seem to float above the ground. the mural behind where teehee sits for our interview is called \"cherokee traditions\" and shows a woman wearing a traditional feather cape; only a handful of cherokee artists who can make them are left.\n",
      "if her bid to be seated as the delegate from the cherokee nation to congress comes to fruition, teehee said, the moment will be bittersweet: the cost was the home, lives, and tears of her ancestors. hundreds of thousands of cherokees never saw the promise fulfilled. \n",
      "\"i feel it now just talking about it — you know, how proud i am to represent my nation. but then i can't help but think about what we lost in the process, too,\" teehee said.  \n",
      "if she gets to take the oath of office, teehee will place her hand on her own bible, written in the cherokee language. her first choice would have been one of her grandfather's old cherokee bibles, but so many of the family's documents and books burned to ash in a 2016 house fire — including a little green cherokee hymn book cherished by her dad. the sound of cherokee hymns reminds teehee of traveling to her parents' home for family funerals. \n",
      "her parents are now in their late 70s and suffering from serious illnesses. teehee said they continue to be a key source of motivation for her work. \n",
      "\"i think of how proud i would be for my parents to be able to be there with me and to be alive to see it as cherokee speakers. i just hope it does happen in their lifetime.\"\n",

      "correction, june 28, 8:44 am: an earlier version of this article misspelled the name and affiliation of the school teehee's parents attended. it was sequoyah high school, and the boarding school was run by the us bureau of indian affairs. the article also misstated the type of federal dollars used to fund the durbin feeling language center; it is us bureau of indian affairs child care dollars.\n",

(ap photo/jose luis magana, file)the associated pressthe \" rage giving \" did not last. abortion access groups who received a windfall of donations following the supreme court's overturning of roe v. wade one year ago say those emergency grants have ended and individual and foundation giving has dropped off. after the dobbs decision, some major funders of abortion access also have ended or shifted funding from organizations working in states where abortion is now banned, said naa amissah hammond, senior director of grantmaking with groundswell fund, which funds grassroots groups organizing for reproductive justice.women's health and foster care nonprofits, who expected increased demand in areas where access to abortion has been eliminated or restricted, say they also haven't seen increased support.holly calvasina said her experience as director of development at the reproductive health clinic choices in memphis, tennessee, might provide an explanation. like many working in the reproductive rights sector, calvasina said she tried to prepare for the increase in need, even before a draft of the supreme court decision was leaked in may last year. while some funders saw the writing on the wall and stepped up support, others wanted to wait and see. \"i think (that) really speaks to kind of a fundamental issue with philanthropy and responding to an emergent crisis,\" calvasina said. \"philanthropy moves really slowly and human rights crises unfold quickly.\" the rollercoaster of giving also showed up for choices in the $150,000 in donations to their annual spring appeal last year. that's up from $2,000 in 2021. this year, the appeal raised $40,000. organizations in states where abortion has been banned or limited have needed to pivot, said marsha jones, executive director of the afiya center, based in dallas. her organization used donations received after the dobbs decision to expand its birthing center, but she said funders are less interested in supporting maternal health than they were in supporting advocacy and practical support for abortions. she argues, as she has for years, that supporting reproductive justice is more than supporting abortion access.\"it is literally people wanting to choose full bodily autonomy,\" she said of those choosing to carry a pregnancy to term and others who do not. data on last year's charitable giving to any sector is hard to come by. the pandemic has slowed the public release of donor reports to the irs, though a delay of up to two years was typical even before covid 19 hit. donations to human services and public society benefit organizations, sectors that could include abortion access nonprofits, both declined in 2022, while donations to health organizations increased 5%, which is actually a decline when adjusted for inflation, according to the giving usa report released last week.but a special layer of opacity exists around funding for abortion access. many donors fund anonymously, sometimes requiring grantees not to publicly disclose the source. the largest historic funder, the susan thompson buffett foundation, eventually makes gifts public through tax filings, but the organization does not comment on support for abortion access and did not respond to questions about whether or how its funding strategy changed in response to the dobbs decision. another large funder, the david and lucile packard foundation, said it is shifting its grantmaking after dobbs. it stopped funding sex education programs in schools and ended funding for abortion services that closed due to new laws. the foundation also added $14.1 million in funding last year to \"shore up providers in safe haven states,\" and to help people find and access abortion care.the william and flora hewlett foundation said it provides steady support to grantees in all states to fund abortion care where it remains legal or advocacy against bans.in general, giving to organizations specifically serving women and girls represents less than 2% of all donations, according to a research project of the women's philanthropy institute at indiana university's lilly family school of philanthropy.calvasina thinks anonymous funding, especially from the largest foundations, perpetuates inequality within the movement. others in the sector said donors have many reasons for wanting to be anonymous, including to avoid being targeted by groups opposing abortion. one measure of the potential amount of funding available to reproductive health organizations is the extent of gifts from donor advised funds hosted by the silicon valley community foundation to planned parenthood affiliates across the country. those donations exceeded $98 million in 2022, according to data from candid, a nonprofit that compiles information about charitable giving. the foundation declined to speak about the gifts, citing its policy not to comment on daf grants. seeing a drop in giving after a major event is not that unusual, said una osili, associate dean for research and international programs at the lilly family school.\"if you think about the decision to give, whether it's to a natural disaster or crisis, people hear about it and they want to participate to make a difference,\" osili said. danielle gletow, founder and executive director at one simple wish, a nonprofit connecting donors with foster children who have specific requests, said people are seeking out groups like hers offering direct support. but she worries that abortion access restrictions may further strain the foster care system. in texas, where the state's child welfare program is so overwhelmed that children sometimes sleep in office buildings, foster care workers fear the state's strict laws on abortion may force women to have children for whom they cannot care, adding to the foster children population.\"i don't think it's possible to break anything worse when it's already broken, if i'm being honest,\" gletow said. \"this is a system that's incredibly broken.\"philanthropic support has surged to states such as new mexico, which passed laws protecting access to abortion and shielding abortion providers while bordering texas and oklahoma, where abortion is now banned. a coalition of local groups publicly asked incoming funders and groups to coordinate with them as recently as february.charlene bencomo, executive director of bold futures, a leader of the coalition, said they ask new providers to accept medicaid, which can cover abortion in the state, and to offer reproductive health services outside of abortion care.\"we continue to look for a higher quality of care, a better quality of care for our folks in new mexico and for those who need to come here to access care that they cannot in their home state,\" bencomo said. amissah hammond, of the groundswell fund, said she's waiting to see if funders who responded with emergency or one time grants last year will continue to fund abortion access over the long term. for funders concerned about legal liabilities, she suggested they offer general operating support, rather than project based grants, and accept updates over the phone. \"we're learning a lot from our peer funders who have been funding in global contexts,\" she said. \"where work for reproductive rights, health and justice has been criminalized for a long time and where lgbtq rights has been criminalized and work, frankly, for democracy has been criminalized.\" ___associated press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the ap's

      "Title: From ‘brain death’ to innovator, the Ukraine war has transformed NATO\n",
      "ever since president vladimir putin gave the order for russian troops to invade ukraine, the international response has understandably focused on how best to end the land war. that has meant sending conventional military hardware – tanks, missile systems, artillery – and training ukrainian soldiers.   not bad for an organization france's president emmanuel macron warned in 2019 was facing \"brain death.\" russia's aggression hasn't been restricted to the battlefield. even before the invasion, nato officials noted a rise in non conventional warfare aimed at ukraine and other western targets. since the start of the war, disinformation, energy restrictions and cyberattacks on infrastructure have all been weaponized by the kremlin to justify and advance its war.   \"a weapon, by its broadest definition, is something that you can use to coerce someone into doing what you want them to do. you can put a gun to their head, you can blackmail them, you can spread disinformation to turn others against them or you can turn off the energy to their house,\" david van weel, nato's assistant secretary general for emerging security challenges, told cnn. those weapons are not only aimed at the target, in this case ukraine. \"russia claims that nato promised never to expand to the east after the dissolution of the soviet union. and although we've been debunking that for years, you see that this keeps coming back. and there's definitely a percentage of our population that falls for this kind of disinformation,\" van weel said.     these sorts of attacks can have very real world impact, van weel explained, referencing a cyberattack that took out german wind farms last year. it is commonly accepted that energy security has been a key feature of the war in ukraine, with russia using energy as a weapon against western allies.   much of the western focus since the start of the war has been on defense spending. it is no secret that the vast majority of nato allies have for years fallen far short of their 2% target, something that has long infuriated officials at nato's brussels hq.  a common explanation as to why this happened is that in the post soviet era, western countries became complacent, feeling that they had won the cold war.   \"countries far away from invasion themselves felt that distance would lead security, and they could continue to ignore the growing urgency of investment in hard security,\" said keir giles, a senior fellow at the london based chatham house think tank.   \"spending 2% of gdp on defence was supposed to be a baseline – the minimum credible level of defence budget. over time, cynical countries who didn't feel at risk pointed to the spending of 2% to claim that they were doing enough on defense. but in reality, there was no stipulation on what that 2% – even if they reached that threshold – was spent on, so it was never an indication of how prepared or useful they might be,\" giles added.    this inertia has also held back the west's ability to deal with cyber and non conventional threats from adversaries, including russia and china. to those working in these areas, it came as no surprise that russia had been so successful interfering in the elections of other nations or that china had so successfully spread disinformation in western countries during the pandemic.   peter caddick adams, a former official nato historian, explains that it is extremely difficult for nations not currently at war to behave as though they are. this war mentality is key when dealing with threats that are not boots on the ground, but are just as aggressive and exist in places that are harder to see.  \"nato could only go as fast as members were willing to invest. if you are a peacetime democracy, it's very difficult to switch to that footing and counterattack your opponent's non conventional attacks. if you are not at war, there will be a limit on what you and your public are willing to spend on things they can't see,\" he told cnn.   while all eyes will be on whether or not sweden becomes the 32nd country to join nato at its summit next month, the collective defense alliance will also use its meeting to show that it's prepared for its future.   it will announce the nato innovation fund, a project that will bring 23 of nato's members together with private business in the technology sector. it will make the participating nations limited partners, meaning they will not seek majority stakes in companies and allow the companies to carry on working with other investors, including from outside nato.   why is an organization like nato taking such a relaxed approach to developing technologies that will soon become so critical to national and international security?  \"innovation used to come from the defense sector. we think of gps and the internet. but that world has completely changed around that now. innovation comes from start ups and academic ecosystems, not from big companies or governments anymore,\" said van weel.   the innovation fund is the second major nato plan to deal with non conventional and emerging threats to launch this year. the defence innovation accelerator for the north atlantic (diana) launched its first pilot challenge program on june 19.    will this push to better prepare the west for whatever the next decade looks like succeed? china, after all, is becoming more hostile and there is no certainty as to how the russia's war in ukraine ends, nor if it spills beyond ukraine's borders. and if the war does end, is there a risk that allies revert to the complacency of the past?  giles argues that nato is dealing with the consequences of decades when its members \"had the luxury of pretending that the problem of defense and security had gone away.\" russia's invasion \"ought to have proven beyond any doubt that europe is under threat and needs to invest in protecting itself, both in terms of conventional and non conventional security,\" he said.   and while politicians are promising renewed spending and attention right now, he fears that convincing the public this is essential, even after ukraine, is \"a leap of imagination that seems beyond the capabilities of most western politicians.\"  caddick adams says that ukraine provides a window for nato to prove that the alliance can act effectively without engaging in war itself, thereby making its members more comfortable with spending in the future.   \"ukraine has become a springboard basically for nato's experiments in this non conventional stuff. without engaging russia, nato has enabled ukraine to try some of the things nato would like to do but politically cannot do. it answers a lot of questions about warmongering or german uneasiness, but militarily in terms of capabilities,\" he said.   it's easy to forget exactly how recently macron made his \"brain death\" comments. the manner in which the alliance was caught cold by putin's escalation might lend some credibility to that view.  but the alliance's unity has been one of the least expected and most welcome aspects of the west's response to the war in ukraine. and the relative stability of the politics within the alliance has created windows for nato to try new things and get the money to do so.   however, officials are also aware that this collegiate approach might not last forever. and it's not the unknown factor of how long the war persists and countries losing interest that worries some officials the most. it's the prospect of elections happening across the alliance in which the issue of ukraine could become a wedge issue – including the small matter of the race for the white house in 2024.   \n",

      "a federal jury in new york convicted three men tuesday of stalking a new jersey family on behalf of the chinese government.  the defendants – michael mcmahon, 55; zhu yong, 66; and zheng congying, 27 – were convicted of conspiracy and stalking charges related to the plot following a three week trial. mcmahon, a former sergeant in the new york city police department, and yong were also convicted of illegally acting as an agent of the people's republic of china.  the guilty verdicts are the first trial victory in the us department of justice's efforts to combat operation fox hunt, the chinese communist party's international alleged anti corruption campaign targeting those the chinese government considers fugitives – often former officials or rich individuals suspected of economic crimes.  three other defendants have pleaded guilty in connection with their roles in the prc directed harassment and intimidation campaign, according to the doj.  the chinese government launched operation fox hunt in 2014 to target wealthy citizens who were accused of corruption and had fled the country with large amounts of money.  \"the defendants engaged in a campaign of harassment and coercion on behalf of the prc to force the victim's repatriation to china from the united states, including by threatening family members,\" us assistant attorney general matthew olsen said in a statement tuesday.   \"the department of justice will hold accountable those who would help repressive regimes violate the fundamental freedoms of people in the u.s.,\" he said.  according to prosecutors, the defendants embarked on a years long campaign targeting a former chinese government official who had lived in the us for several years. the three men threatened, harassed, surveilled and intimidated the man and his family between 2016 and 2019 to return to china, they said.  defendants left threatening note, doj says in 2015, the chinese government prompted interpol to issue an international red notice for the former chinese official and his wife, alleging they were wanted by the prc on corruption related charges, the doj said.  prosecutors said yong hired mcmahon, who was working as a private investigator, to get information about the targeted man, his family and his daughter from government databases. mcmahon then reported back to yong and others, including a police officer with the chinese government, to give details about the family, prosecutors said.  mcmahon also surveilled the man's sister in law as part of the operation, which was orchestrated by prc officials.  the plot included recording the former official's daughter, taping a threatening note to the front door of his house, and flying his elderly father from china – allegedly against his will – in 2017 to pressure his son to return to china.  prosecutors said the note, which defendant zheng left at the family's new jersey home after attempting to force open the front door, stated: \"if you are willing to go back to the mainland and spend 10 years in prison, your wife and children will be all right. that's the end of this matter!\"   the us government charged eight people, including six chinese citizens, related to the plot in 2020. three other defendants previously pleaded guilty in connection with the scheme, prosecutors said.  speaking at a news conference in october 2020 after the charges were announced, then us assistant attorney general john c. demers said the arrests sent a message that the us \"will not tolerate this type of flagrant conduct on our shores.\" \"without coordination with our government, china's repatriation squads enter the united states, surveil and locate the alleged fugitives, and deploy intimidation and other tactics to force them back into china where they would face certain imprisonment or worse following illegitimate trials,\" he said at the time. \n",

      "desperately projecting that everything is as it was, the kremlin is only emphasizing how much has changed. these were 36 hours that provided a glimpse of the end of russian president vladimir putin's rule. almost every action was improbable, at best a week ago – much was inconceivable, 17 months ago. a loyal henchman slams the premise of the invasion, then claims an airstrike targeted his troops, before taking a major military town without clashes, prigozhin said, and then marching to within a few hundred miles of moscow. but suddenly he executes a baffling reversal, turning back to avoid bloodshed, as the kremlin claims alexander lukashenko, the president of belarus whom putin seems to treat with contempt, brokered a dramatic reprieve, in which the insurrectionist who has his armor bound for moscow, now opts for exile in minsk. even as the dust settles, it still makes little sense. it is important to remember we have yet to hear from yevgeny prigozhin that he has accepted exile in belarus and see evidence his units have genuinely all stood down. he is an open proliferator of misinformation. we should be equally suspicious of the apparent bow with which kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov tried to tie this startling episode up with on saturday night. two hours earlier, wagner were at the gates of the capital (almost), and then suddenly everything is forgiven. there are large parts of this story missing. we may never learn what they are. many emotions could have altered prigozhin's course. was the advance north too easy? did he accept entering the capital would leave his men vulnerable, even to a weak russian military response? were the regular military not joining him in large enough number? did he believe a climbdown would only grow his support? while on the surface, prigozhin's climbdown makes him appear weak, even finished, he has been the decision maker over the past 36 hours.  putin has been left reacting. silent initially, and then bombastically angry and confident, promising \"inevitable punishment\" for the \"scum.\" but hours later, this was all forgotten. putin's emotional state   were it known   is arguably less revealing than his actions. by letting prigozhin go, and apparently sweeping the entire insurrection under the carpet, he's appeared the weakest yet in 23 years.  it is possible his special services will now pursue wagner and its supporters, slowly, away from the glare of the last two days. yet the kremlin's solution to the problem was to climb down too. it's a move so antipathetic to everything putin stands for, it can only suggest he had no other choice: that he lacked the forces to be sure he could hold prigozhin back.  that is perhaps the larger lesson of the so called march of justice. not that a mercenary boss didn't send a modest sized force into moscow to execute a coup, but that the kremlin had to let him go.  putin's vulnerability is assured putin's position was clearly weakening because of the war's catastrophic mismanagement. but how he would be removed   what possible circumstances could permit that   was something that eluded officials and analysts. this was not a likely option.  but now it has happened, we have a glimpse behind the thickset curtain the kremlin relies upon to hide its infighting, incompetence and frailty, allowing it to project an outsized confidence – a post soviet omnipotence. it's pretty ugly in there it seems. now the rest of the world has seen this too – from ukraine to nato to putin's allies. notably some friends were quiet: kazakhstan and iran – both of whom owe russia a past debt – called this an \"internal matter.\" that is not unqualified support.  we can only guess whether the thought of prigozhin in charge will cause such panic in the elite country houses of suburban moscow that support for putin sustains. yet his vulnerability is now assured, for the first time in 23 years – two decades in which he has accrued plentiful enemies and debts. (it is ridiculous to maintain the last two days have been an elaborate charade designed to somehow improve putin's position or provide a pretext for escalation. this is an entirely internal affair, distracting from the urgent needs of the war. making the kremlin head seem this unequivocally weak can in no way strengthen his position). so where does this leave russia and its anxious adversaries? we can't know what comes next, but it is likely to follow the explosively erratic pattern of the last two days. prigozhin may vanish for a few months. putin may make some changes in his military staff. things may seem \"normal.\" but they have absolutely changed and a post putin world – and the dramatic force needed to impose it – has been glimpsed. it feels like the beginning of the end for him. the most acute catalyst to any change will be the impact this bizarre drama has on the ukraine frontlines. it is impossible to imagine that a series of fluctuations in russia's military presence has not weakened defensive positions in the south and east – the very places where ukraine is pushing forwards. the most optimistic assessment you could make is that russian military morale must have felt a hiccup while watching its commander in chief and most prominent military figure engage in a 24 hour game of chicken. would you genuinely give your life on the russian front lines this weekend, given the mess you observe in the higher command? ukraine claims to be already pushing forward. it is too early to know what impact the justice march has had on the war. but the kremlin must be acutely aware of the damage to both the positions of putin and prigozhin if this conflict – which moscow has framed as an existential battle against nato – is ultimately lost. perhaps that stark recognition was quietly feeding the bizarre decisions and reversals as wagner fighters made such easy progress on saturday north on the m4 highway to moscow. \n",

      "Title: Wagner Group shot down 6 Russian helicopters and a plane during its mini-rebellion, weakening Putin's air force at a time when it could prove critical\n",
      "wagner group forces took out six russian helicopters and another aircraft during yevgeny prigozhin's short lived rebellion, ukrainian officials said sunday, in a development that could hand ukraine a defensive edge in the fighting.according to the kyiv independent, yurii ihnat, a ukrainian air force spokesperson, emphasized the benefit to ukraine, saying: \"mi 8 transport helicopters are powerful hardware that really helps the russian army in its war against ukraine.\"reports differ on the exact specifications of the destroyed aircraft. ihnat has said that wagner took out two attack helicopters and four transport aircraft, while pro kremlin military bloggers were cited by the kyiv independent as saying three of them were electronic warfare helicopters. the open source weapons tracker site oryx, whose helicopter tally matches that of the cited military bloggers, said it had documented evidence of the following russian losses: a mi 35 attack helicopter, a ka 52 attack helicopter, three mi 8 electronic warfare helicopters, one mi 8 transport, and an il 22m airborne command post.it added that prigozhin had captured a russian mrap patrol vehicle and a tigr m infantry mobility vehicle. oryx said that prigozhin had lost two trucks, two technical vehicles, and an infantry mobility vehicle to the russian army proper. after an astonishing 36 hours, which saw prigozhin direct his militia into action on russian soil and then make a rush toward moscow, russian leadership and the paramilitary boss reached a wary agreement in which prigozhin was exiled to belarus.hanna malyar, ukraine's deputy defense minister, told the associated press: \"the enemy's weakness is always a window of opportunity. it allows us to take the advantage.\"it's too soon to see how the chaos between wagner and the russian military establishment will affect things on the ground, she said.on sunday, as the wagner debacle unfolded in russia, ukrainian soldiers near bakhmut told agence france presse that it did not appear to have affected the situation there.\"as it attacked yesterday, russia continued to attack today,\" a soldier identified only as nazar told the outlet. nonetheless, the loss of six helicopters in a single weekend is significant.in one year of defending against russia, ukraine had shot down about 30 of russia's helicopters, forbes reported in february. at that time, russia had about 300 helicopters — around half of them attack helicopters — based near its western borders, the kyiv post reported.as the recent chaos unfolded in russia, ukraine said it had managed to push forward in its counteroffensive. as of early monday local time, ukraine's military said it had advanced half a mile around the ukrainian city of bakhmut, the guardian reported. nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said monday that prigozhin's rebellion was evidence putin had made a \"big strategic mistake\" in invading ukraine last year, the outlet added. \n",

      "Title: Wagner leader Prigozhin will move to Belarus following the mercenary group's uprising against Putin, Kremlin spokesman says\n",
      "the kremlin has forged a deal with wagner group boss yevgeny prigozhin to defuse the mercenary group's uprising on saturday.in exchange for prigozhin's exile to belarus, the mercenary leader won't be prosecuted, the associated press reported, citing a kremlin spokesperson.the reported agreement comes after a paramilitary rebellion on saturday in which the wagner group marched across russia before suddenly turning around just 120 miles from moscow. prigozhin said he didn't want to shed russian blood.kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov announced saturday that prigozhin — and the troops who follow him — will not face criminal prosecution as part of the deal. he also said those troops who did not join in the uprising would be offered defense ministry contracts. saturday's rebellion marked the strongest threat to president vladimir putin's power in over 20 years. prigozhin had dubbed his procession towards moscow a \"march for justice,\" and made baseless claims that russia's defense minister had ordered an air strike on the wagner group on friday and killed large numbers of troops. the kremlin denied the allegation.earlier on saturday, prigozhin posted a voice note to his telegram channel, calling his 25,000 troops \"patriots\" and defending their cause. \"we don't want the country to continue to live any longer in corruption, deceit, and bureaucracy,\" prigozhin said, according to a reuters translation.belarus president aleksandr lukashenko, a close putin ally who has also long known prigozhin, spent all day saturday negotiating with prigozhin, according to the new york times. prigozhin was once, himself, a close putin ally, but tensions have grown high since russia's invasion of ukraine in 2022. prigozhin evenly openly criticized russia's invasion of ukraine as a \"racket\" in a public statement last week, the times reported. though he didn't directly criticize putin, he publicly refuted russia's justification for the invasion. \"the war wasn't needed to return russian citizens to our bosom, nor to demilitarize or denazify ukraine,\" prigozhin said. \"the war was needed so that a bunch of animals could simply exult in glory.\"the wagner group's rebellion first began friday. by the next day, putin had formally accused prigozhin of treason and issued a warrant for his arrest.moscow had been bracing for violence, with residents fleeing, city officials warning people to stay home, and workers destroying highways leading into the city.by saturday, the wagner group had apparently gained control of military headquarters in rostov on don, a city 660 miles south of moscow where russia's operations in ukraine are managed, according to the associated press. on saturday, the mercenary group was reportedly also in lipesk province, just 225 miles south of moscow. \n",

      "Title: An epic fight over how real-estate agents get paid could transform the housing market forever\n",
      "let's say you're ready to sell your house. trying to find a buyer and sifting through offers sounds like a nightmare, so you hire a real estate agent. in exchange for their guidance, you agree to pay the agent 3% of the sale price, which they say is industry standard. your agent advises you that in order to drum up sufficient interest in your home, you should also promise to cover the commission for the buyer's agent — another 3% of the sale price. this seems like a hefty chunk of change, but you go along with the setup since you almost certainly couldn't navigate the transaction without some professional help. you get some glossy photos taken, hang a sign in your front yard, and wait for the offers to pour in. when the deal closes, however, you don't cut a check to both agents. instead you give 6% of your proceeds to your agent, who then splits that with the buyer's broker.as the money makes its way to all the players in the transaction, you may wonder: why does it work this way? according to the plaintiffs of two massive class action lawsuits, this circuitous method of paying real estate agents is all part of a far reaching scheme that is bilking home sellers out of billions of dollars every year. the heart of the problem, according to the lawsuits, are the multiple listing services — local, online databases where agents share photos and detailed information about homes for sale. the mlss are a central component of the us real estate market, and the most critical tools that licensed agents have at their disposal — in fact, they're one of the most persuasive reasons for even hiring an agent in the first place. in order to access an mls, listing agents must agree that money from the sale will follow the prescribed, serpentine path. but now two multibillion dollar lawsuits — sitzer et al. v. nar et al. and moehrl et al. v. nar et al. — threaten to upend the entire system. the plaintiffs, representing a large swath of home sellers around the country, are accusing the national association of realtors and some of the country's largest brokerages of using mls rules to charge exorbitant fees and unfairly prop up agent commissions. these lawsuits are finally coming to a head after simmering for several years, and if the plaintiffs succeed, they could rewrite the rules of how agents get paid. the seller might no longer pay out both agents' commissions after the sale closes. instead, a buyer would pay their agent directly. proponents say these changes would increase competition among agents, dramatically lower commissions, and potentially save consumers as much as $20 billion to $30 billion a year. the defendants, led by the nar, argue that the current setup actually favors consumers by providing broad access to an efficient real estate market. despite the potentially earthshaking consequences, most local real estate agents — who, to be fair, have more pressing short term concerns — have largely ignored the cases. but if the plaintiffs prevail, these cases could radically reshape what buying and selling a home looks like, and they represent the biggest existential threat to the real estate industry today.when you buy a home with the help of a real estate agent, paying for their services will probably be among the least of your worries — and agents are happy to have it that way. the rules are designed to make their commissions as inconspicuous as possible: since the seller pays both agents, the buyer doesn't pay anything up front. until just a few years ago, realtors were even allowed to tell buyers that their services were free. of course, that's not really the case. the buyer is the one coming up with the money for the property, after all. but the illusion helps agents preserve their commissions, the plaintiffs argue, since buyers don't have to think about the fees, and sellers are incentivized to promise high commissions in order to get brokers to look favorably upon their properties. the nar argues that this is the most efficient arrangement. buyers don't have to pay out of pocket for their agent, and sellers benefit from closing the deal without delays over which agent gets paid what. but detractors, including the plaintiffs in the two lawsuits, say this setup forces sellers to pay inflated commissions to buyers' agents in order to generate interest in their homes. and they say the defendants in the case — the nar along with large brokerages like re/max, keller williams, anywhere real estate (formerly realogy), and homeservices of america — have benefited from this shell game. ultimately, the rules of the mls are the sticking points. what agents collectively refer to as the mls is actually a web of roughly 600 independent, local databases around the country. nearly 97% of these mlss are owned or operated by local realtor associations, according to court filings, and are governed by rules mandated by the nar. the reach of the mls is incredibly powerful — nearly 86% of sellers last year listed their properties on the databases, according to the nar. in exchange for this access, the nar requires sellers who list on an mls to agree to the \"cooperative compensation rule\" — the expectation that the seller will pay a commission to the buyer's agent.the rule is the primary target of the two class action lawsuits, both of which are seeking billions of dollars in damages. sellers, the plaintiffs argue, had no choice but to list their homes on an mls. this, in turn, meant they were forced to agree to the rules of the databases — including paying exorbitant commissions to buyers' agents who might choose to pass over their properties if they didn't. the first case to reach trial will be sitzer et al. v. nar et al., which was filed in missouri and is scheduled for an october trial. total damages in the case could reach nearly $4 billion. in the larger of the two cases, moehrl et al. v. nar et al., damages could total more than $40 billion. that case, which was filed in illinois, would likely reach a trial in the first half of 2024. brokerages named in the suits either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.stephen brobeck, a senior fellow at the consumer federation of america, told me that one of the biggest problems identified in the cases is what's known as \"steering.\" since agents representing buyers can see the promised commission for each home in the mls, they can discourage their clients from viewing properties with unsatisfactory paydays. the nar doesn't set a minimum commission that listing brokers need to promise to their counterparts on the buyer's side — technically, it could be as little as $1. but the going rate is typically between 2.5% and 3% of the total sale price, so anything below that amount means the sellers' home could be less likely to get traction. \"they not only have to pay a buyer's agent commission, but they can't negotiate that commission,\" brobeck said of sellers. \"because if they lower that commission, research has shown that the house is less likely to be shown by the buyer agents.\" one study found that properties listed with sub 2.5% commission rates were 5% less likely to sell and took 12% longer to sell.while the plaintiffs in these cases take aim at other rules that they say hinder negotiations over compensation, their primary goal is to \"decouple\" the commissions paid to the buyer's agent and the seller's agent. if each party just pays for their own agent directly, the theory goes, there will be more transparency and more incentives for clients to negotiate with their brokers. \"it just doesn't make any sense for the seller to have to pay the buyer's agent,\" brobeck told me.katie johnson, the chief legal officer for the nar, told me the current model benefits both buyers and sellers by encouraging cooperation between agents.\"making an offer of compensation is good for the seller, because that is their listing broker making an offer to all the other professionals in the area to go to work, put your time and effort in finding this buyer, because you'll get paid for the work,\" johnson told me. \"i think that's pretty intuitive.\" buyers, meanwhile, \"benefit tremendously\" because they don't have to pay out of pocket for those expenses, johnson said.  the nar and its predecessors have periodically faced legal challenges over industry practices that critics say discourage competition and lead to inflated broker commissions. while the internet has broadened access to real estate listings and the competition among agents has intensified over the past two decades, commission rates have remained stubbornly high relative to countries with comparable housing markets such as australia, the netherlands, and the united kingdom. nicholas economides, a professor of economics at new york university and an expert witness for the plaintiffs in the moehrl case, found that in those three markets, only about 5% to 20% of homebuyers used agents compared to 87% in the us. the buyers who did use agents typically paid 1% to 2% in commissions, compared to the 2% to 3% that's common here. sellers, meanwhile, paid 1% to 3%, compared to the 2% to 3% in the us. there have been other legal challenges to the current commission arrangement, including an antitrust investigation against the nar by the trump administration that led to a settlement — but the system so far has remained largely intact. \"we will continue to fight these cases because the model that we are currently working with,  first of all, has improved, iterated, and innovated over the last 50 years,\" johnson said. \"it will continue to innovate. but it has always been lawful and serves the best interests of consumers.\"depending on whom you ask, the pending lawsuits could either revolutionize or ruin the real estate industry. but despite the billions of dollars at stake, the legal fights have mostly amounted to background noise — at least so far.\"everyone's not really paying that much attention,\" rob hahn, a longtime consultant to local mlss and realtor associations, told me. \"i think agents and brokers just figure, 'we'll solve this somehow.'\"that may end up being true, but the stakes for every person in the real estate industry are incredibly high. the sheer size of the damages sought by the plaintiffs would undoubtedly wreak havoc on the industry's largest players. but for regular agents, there would also be a reckoning. if buyers have to pay out of pocket for their agents, many might choose to not hire an agent at all, or just pay an agent by the hour for their insight. agents would face more competition for clients and potentially depressed commissions. the current glut of agents would become more glaring, and a mass exodus from the industry could ensue. the nar argues that this would be a calamity for first time and low income buyers who don't have the cash on hand to pay an agent upfront, and would therefore risk being deprived of that expertise. brobeck, of the cfa, told me he believes the industry would be highly incentivized to find ways to allow buyers to obtain financing for their broker's fees, the way they already finance their home. in some cases, sellers could still agree to pay the buyer agent's commissions. and because of the increased attention on commissions, both buyers and sellers would be more likely to negotiate those costs down, brobeck said.  \"i think the most successful, experienced, and competent agents will continue to be able to charge what they're charging now,\" brobeck told me. \"but the many agents who are inexperienced, less competent, less successful, will not be able to charge the going rate.\"if the typical total commissions for a real estate sale were to fall to between 3% and 4%, instead of the customary 5% to 6% today, brobeck estimates the potential savings for consumers could reach $20 billion to $30 billion a year.but a victory for the plaintiffs is far from guaranteed, some experts say. since the nar doesn't mandate that brokers representing the seller promise a specific amount to their buyer agent counterparts, the plaintiffs will have to prove that requiring any compensation at all hurts sellers, david eisenstadt, a managing director at berkeley research group and a former senior economist at the justice department's antitrust division, told me. the defendants could then argue something like this: if a seller is able to offer a commission of as little as $1, that's basically the same as offering zero dollars, so that requirement really isn't that onerous at all. the defense could also argue that sellers should pay the buyer agent's commission because they actually benefit the most from their service, eisenstadt said — namely, bringing forth a buyer who's willing to shell out hundreds of thousands of dollars for their home. \"there are really strong efficiency reasons for sellers to pay the buyer broker commission at settlement, rather than the buyer,\" eisenstadt said. on the other hand, hahn, who now runs a startup focused on bringing the auction model to residential real estate, told me he's doubtful of nar's chances of winning in court and believes some kind of settlement is likely. with the smaller of the two suits slated for trial in just a few months, the industry has little time to come to grips with what the future could hold. \"this is a real, serious threat,\" hahn said. \"this is not a joke.\"james rodriguez is a senior

      "tesla ceo elon musk has dropped the prices of tesla models six times since the start of the year, kicking off tesla price wars with mainstream car brands like ford and gm. here's a look at where the pricing stands for each of the models. the tesla model 3 is the cheapest model. the starting price for the tesla model 3 is around $40,240 for the real wheel drive, $47,240 for the long range variant, and $53,240 for the performance variant.the next cheapest model is the tesla model y. the starting price for the tesla model y is around $47,490 for the all wheel drive and $54,490 for the performance model. in early 2023, extensive tesla markdowns on the prices of the model 3 and model y hit the market, making some cost less than the average new car in the us. tesla model s and the model x are the most expensive models. the tesla model s is around $88,490 for the long range variant and $108,490 for the plaid variant.the starting price for the tesla model x: the starting price for the tesla model x is around $98,490 and $108,490 for the plaid variant.the tesla roaster is expected to be the most expensive model when it enters production, at a base price of around $200,000. as part of the 2023 inflation reduction act, some tesla models are eligible for a $7,500 ev tax credit, while others can receive a smaller credit of $3,750. as of june, three model y variants were eligible for full credit while only the performance version of the model 3 can receive the full $7,500 credit. the two other model 3 versions are eligible for half credit. a big concern for prospective ev buyers is if the battery will need replacing. ev battery replacements could cost anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000, according to recurrent.in tesla's 2021 impact report, it said that the company's battery packs are designed to outlast the vehicle. \"we estimate that a vehicle gets scrapped after approximately 200,000 miles of usage in the u.s. and roughly 150,000 miles in europe,\" the report said. tesla's batteries are also covered by a warranty. models have slightly different warranties, but they're generally covered for 8 years or between 100,000 150,000 miles (whatever comes first). while evs as a category do have more frequent problems than other vehicles such as issues with battery packs and charging, tesla models stand out for their reliability. no, tesla charging isn't free, and the cost varies based on if you charge at home or at one of tesla's proprietary superchargers. at a supercharger, charging costs vary based on the speed across four tiers and are based on time — not range or energy added to your vehicle. charges will also change based on electricity costs. on average, a tesla will charge for about 4.5 cents per mile, according to energysage estimates, depending on local electricity costs. a full charge on a level 2 charger will run you about $15.52 on average, the site says, though costs vary for each model. the cost of charging a tesla is more than 3 times cheaper per mile than the cost of fueling a gas powered car.energysage estimates that it costs $614.95 to charge your tesla per year. in comparison, gas powered cars cost an average of $1,850.42 to fuel per year.tesla superchargers also charge an \"idle fee\" if a car remains plugged in after it is fully charged, in order to serve more customers efficiently. some tesla vehicles also include free charging, which is sometimes added as an incentive when purchasing. free charging is also available through tesla's referral program. to get the cheapest charging, you'll need to charge at home. if you already have a 240 volt outlet in your garage (equivalent to level 2), you can simply buy a charger and plug it in. otherwise, an electrician will likely need to install one for you. here's what to know about charging teslas at home. \n",

      "modi's india is seeking to challenge china economically, as well, launching a program known as \"make in india\" to entice multinational corporations to move much of their supply chains to india, often out of china. following the disastrous chinese coronavirus lockdowns in china, which have ravaged the nation's already weak communist economy, new delhi has successfully signed agreements with companies such as apple and foxconn to expand their manufacturing in india.\n",

      "the blackouts have been so severe that south africa has reduced its carbon emissions to such a level that it is one of the world's few countries to be exceeding onerous, climate change related emissions reduction goals.\n",
      "the anc has offered few solutions for the ongoing power crisis, which disproportionately affects poor south africans as the wealthy have begun depending on private generators. the pivot to china arrives in the context of many other african nations also welcoming chinese investment to the continent, often with disastrous results.\n",

      "\n",
      "under the chinese belt and road initiative (bri), the communist party has taken up infrastructure projects in ethiopia, kenya, rwanda, tanzania, zimbabwe, and many other african nations. the presence of chinese officials and business leaders has led to mounting reports of racism against locals, including cases of chinese businessmen whipping rwandan laborers, gang beating kenyan engineers, and forcing malawian children to film racist videos for the amusement of chinese social media users in which they refer to themselves unknowingly, in mandarin, as \"black monsters.\"\n",

      "Title: Supreme Court’s surprise Voting Rights Act ruling could lead to a fairer map in Louisiana\n",
      "we just saw the latest impact from the supreme court's recent surprise ruling on the voting rights act — the surprise being that the court sided with voting rights in that alabama case. after that june 8 ruling in allen v. milligan, the court on monday dismissed a similar voting rights act appeal from louisiana — with the upshot being that a fairer congressional map may be used in louisiana ahead of the 2024 elections. more broadly, the milligan case puts democrats in a better position to win the house of representatives. in milligan, a bare majority of the supreme court upheld a crucial part of the voting rights act, the landmark civil rights law that the court had previously gutted another part of in shelby county v. holder. given the court's opposition to voting rights over the years, including in shelby county, a similar ruling was expected in the alabama case.  but in a 5 4 vote, the court said the alabama map in question diluted black voting power. the ruling paved the way for fairer maps not only in alabama but in other states, such as louisiana — specifically, it carved a path for adding a second \"majority minority\" district, creating the possibility of more equal representation relative to the state's population.  to be sure, the supreme court already did damage on this front, by allowing these apparently illegal maps in the 2022 midterms, in which republicans barely won the house, before its surprise ruling in milligan. and further litigation will proceed in the louisiana case at the 5th u.s. circuit court of appeals, the most right wing appeals court in the country. so we will see how the 5th circuit handles the case going forward. but with milligan as precedent, it will be more difficult for right wing courts to dismantle voting rights. subscribe to the deadline: legal blog newsletter for weekly updates on the top legal stories, including news from the supreme court, the donald trump investigations and more. \n",

      "Title: Lawsuit against ChatGPT creator shows the creepiness of AI\n",
      "this was bound to happen.  openai, the tech company responsible for developing the artificial intelligence chatbot known as chatgpt, is being sued over its practice of scraping other people's information from the internet in order to provide users of the tool with seemingly human responses.  microsoft, a major investor in openai, is also named as a defendant. openai and microsoft do not appear to have publicly commented on the lawsuit. the class action lawsuit strikes at the heart of generative ai tools that appear to create content from \"scratch,\" like chatgpt. in reality, such chatbots are built to scour the internet (including social media platforms) to inform their responses.  for those who aren't techies, think of chatbots like a super powered internet search. while you historically would type in a term and then receive a list of links, chatbot responses rapidly search the internet for content that's already been created, as well as other information that may exist on the web, and synthesize the findings into a human sounding response.  the lawsuit claims openai engages in theft when its technology does this: (note: openai isn't the only company creating generative ai tools, though it's arguably the most popular. hence the \"arms race\" line in the quote above.) the lawsuit accuses openai of scraping data belonging to millions of users, including online conversations, location data and other personal information that the company is able to obtain through third party applications. the suit lists spotify, stripe, slack, snapchat, microsoft teams and the health app mychart as some of the third parties that allow openai access to user data. openai secretly harvests \"massive amounts of personal data from the internet,\" the suit claims, \"including private information and private conversations, medical data, information about children—essentially every piece of data exchanged on the internet it could take—without notice to the owners or users of such data, much less with anyone's permission.\" the lawsuit doesn't list the plaintiffs' names beyond initials — in order to \"avoid intrusive scrutiny as well as any potentially dangerous backlash\" — but it does offer details about their claims. some of the plaintiffs say they're worried that their online content could be used to help replace human workers with robots. for example, the lawsuit says one educator is \"concerned that defendants have taken her skills and expertise, as reflected in her online contributions, and incorporated it into products that could someday result in professional obsolescence for professors and educators like her.\"  the suit also claims that without \"this unprecedented theft of private and copyrighted information belonging to real people, communicated to unique communities, for specific purposes, targeting specific audiences, the products would not be the multi billion dollar business they are today.\" it's no overstatement to say this lawsuit could slow — if not completely alter — the fast moving world of generative ai. visual artists whose works have been scraped by ai tools have already filed at least one class action suit of their own, claiming this amounts to copyright infringement. several musicians have spoken out against the use of generative ai in their industry as well. but professional artists and creators clearly aren't the only ones with skin in the game here, as the latest lawsuit suggests. everyone who uses the internet should be invested in making sure our data isn't being used — to great profit and potential peril — by some of the most powerful tech companies in the world.  \n",

      "Title: Supreme Court strikes down Biden student loan relief plan\n",
      "the supreme court on friday struck down the biden administration's student loan forgiveness plan that would have canceled billions of dollars of debt for millions of americans. chief justice john roberts wrote the 6 3 decision, claiming the federal government lacked authority for the plan. but as justice elena kagan pointed out in her dissent, it was the majority, not the government, that overreached here. \"in every respect, the court today exceeds its proper, limited role in our nation's governance,\" she wrote, joined by her fellow democratic appointees, justices sonia sotomayor and ketanji brown jackson. apparently anticipating this outcome, the white house on friday signaled \"new actions\" coming to protect student loan borrowers. in announcing the plan last august, the white house aimed to reduce \"a significant burden on america's middle class\" by easing the \"crushing\" effects of student loans. the plan applied to people whose annual income was less than $125,000 ($250,000 for households) in either 2020 or 2021, providing up to $10,000 for most borrowers and up to $20,000 for pell grant recipients with greater financial need.  during oral arguments in february, the republican appointees were skeptical of the government's power to forgive that much debt. the court's democratic appointees were skeptical that the challengers — republican led states and individual borrowers — even had legal standing to challenge debt relief in the first place. jackson at the time noted that the court would break new ground by finding standing here.  (in a related case on friday, department of education v. brown, involving individual borrowers, the court unanimously agreed the challengers didn't have legal standing to bring the claim. but the plan was struck down by the decision roberts authored, involving the states' challenge, biden v. nebraska.) the law at issue is the 2003 heroes act. it lets the secretary of education \"waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision\" to protect borrowers affected by national emergencies, among other things. the biden administration pointed to the covid 19 pandemic as the emergency allowing debt forgiveness.  the administration wrote to the justices ahead of the arguments that \"the acute public health emergency caused by covid 19 is abating\" but \"the heroes act and the secretary's plan are not aimed at stopping the spread of disease; they are concerned with economic consequences.\" but the court majority's complaint, essentially, was that the government went too big.  \"the secretary has never previously claimed powers of this magnitude under the heroes act,\" roberts wrote, with seeming amazement at how different circumstances call for different responses, adding that \"past waivers and modifications issued under the act have been extremely modest and narrow in scope.\"  obviously, though, covid 19 didn't happen before it happened. pointing out this plain fact, kagan observed, \"past actions were more modest because the precipitating emergencies were more modest.\" she faulted the majority for deciding \"that some 40 million americans will not receive the benefits the plan provides, because (so says the court) that assistance is too 'significan[t].'\" and the court shouldn't have found standing in this case either, kagan argued. \"the court's first overreach in this case is deciding it at all,\" she wrote. she called the states \"classic ideological plaintiffs: they think the plan a very bad idea, but they are no worse off because the secretary differs.\"  \"a court acting like a court,\" kagan wrote, would have tossed the case on standing grounds.  her critique was apparently too much for the victors to handle, as roberts felt the need to chastise it as he closed his opinion. \"it has become a disturbing feature of some recent opinions to criticize the decisions with which they disagree as going beyond the proper role of the judiciary,\" the chief justice wrote, tone policing the losing side of the dispute.  \"we do not mistake this plainly heartfelt disagreement for disparagement,\" roberts assured the nation, adding that it's \"important that the public not be misled either. any such misperception would be harmful to this institution and our country.\" but who cares if the justices are disparaging one another? the harm to the institution is coming from court actions like friday's rulings, not by the justices using strong language in their opinions. thus, keeping in line with his ruling's reasoning, roberts ended the opinion, and the term, by going beyond his proper role. read the full text of the opinion striking down biden's student loan forgiveness plan below. subscribe to the deadline: legal blog newsletter for weekly updates on the top legal stories, including news from the supreme court, the donald trump investigations and more. \n",

      "Title: McCarthy finds new ways to tell far-right flank what it wants to hear\n",
      "the very idea of congress un impeaching someone seems laughable. that doesn't mean house republicans won't try to do it anyway. as we discussed last week, two prominent gop members — house republican conference chair elise stefanik of new york and georgia's marjorie taylor greene — unveiled a pair of measures to \"expunge\" both of donald trump's impeachments. (greene's resolution would effectively cancel the former president's 2019 impeachment, while stefanik's measure would undo his 2021 impeachment. both republicans are co sponsoring each other's bills.) to be sure, ridiculous measures such as these are introduced all the time, and they're fairly easy to ignore because they stand little chance of advancing. but as the associated press reported, the \"expunge\" scheme picked up a powerful endorsement the day after it began in earnest. \"i think it is appropriate,\" the house speaker told reporters. \"just as i thought before — that you should expunge it, because it never should have gone through.\" to briefly recap for those just joining us, it was in early 2020, just two days after his first senate impeachment trial wrapped up, when trump first broached the subject of invalidating what had happened to him. \"should they expunge the impeachment in the house?\" trump asked during a brief q&a with reporters. \"they should because it was a hoax.\" a handful of gop members pushed the idea in the last congress, though the efforts were ignored — there was a democratic majority in the house at the time — but as the current congress got underway, mccarthy said he was willing to take a look at the idea. evidently, the house speaker is done looking, and he's ready to throw his support behind the gambit. (as for how such an unprecedented procedure would work, my msnbc colleague hayes brown wrote a terrific piece on this that ran this morning.) what's more, this isn't the only step mccarthy is willing to take to make his far right flank happy. punchbowl news reported: as part of the push, the house speaker has effectively directed house judiciary committee chairman jim jordan to bring david weiss, the trump appointed u.s. attorney who investigated hunter biden, before the panel. as for what far right house republicans might consider \"satisfactory answers,\" it's hardly outlandish to wonder if there's anything that could fully satisfy gop members desperate to impeach someone for something. what's less clear is what's driving mccarthy's latest declarations. in the recent past, the california republican was opposed to impeachment crusades and didn't seem at all interested in pursing a trump based legislative agenda. now, the house speaker has raised the prospect of impeaching multiple cabinet secretaries, and he's on board with trying to un impeach the former president. we've never received a full and detailed list of the private side deals mccarthy struck in january to get his speaker's gavel, or the more recent agreements he reached after the house freedom caucus seized control of the house floor. it's hard not to wonder: is mccarthy backing outlandish ideas because he genuinely believes they're worthwhile, or is he still repaying debts to his more radical members? \n",

      "Title: Prosecutions of ‘Cop City’ protesters in Georgia take ominous turn\n",
      "there's been a shake up in the prosecution of protesters who have demonstrated against plans for a massive new police compound in atlanta that critics have dubbed \"cop city.\" and the news is raising questions about politicized law enforcement in georgia.  more than 40 people are facing domestic terrorism charges in connection with protests in recent months, according to the associated press. on friday, the district attorney of dekalb county, sherry boston, announced that she'll no longer take part in their prosecutions, which will now be overseen by georgia's republican attorney general, chris carr. the statement from the dekalb da's office said: the announcement followed a report from the intercept last week that the georgia ag had denied boston's request to drop domestic terrorism charges against a southern poverty law center legal observer who was arrested at the construction site in march. critics of \"cop city,\" including many faith leaders, oppose the 85 acre facility because it requires destroying part of a forest and they worry that it would contribute to overpolicing in dekalb, a majority black county. one protester, known as tortuguita, was fatally shot by police in january. the dekalb district attorney's withdrawal from the prosecutions was celebrated by activists. in a statement, the naacp legal defense fund's associate director counsel, tona boyd, called it a \"welcome development\" but added that it \"also deepens our serious concern about whether these arrests have been motivated by something other than an impartial and objective evaluation of the evidence or a just exercise of prosecutorial discretion.\" indeed, this development is colored by troubling events at the state level. in recent months, georgia republicans have taken steps to usurp power from liberal district attorneys and circumvent their wishes. these moves, including legislation that makes it easier to oust das from their posts, are part of an effort to cast liberal das as soft on crime. as the naacp ldf said, it's good news that the dekalb da is no longer engaging in this tough on crime charade when it comes to the \"cop city\" cases. but the republican ag still will be — and that's deeply concerning.  \n",

      "Author(s): Chris van Tulleken\n",
      "Title: It’s Time to End the Tyranny of Ultra-Processed Food\n",
      "this type of food is usually wrapped in plastic and has additives that you won't find in a typical kitchen. in the us and the uk, we get on average 60 percent of our calories from upf products like pizza, bread, breakfast cereals, biscuits, and nutritional drinks. they're often sold as healthy options, but it's just a way of turning our ill health into money. upf is a byproduct of a complicated financial system that involves repurposing waste from animal food into human food.\n",
      "to solve this problem, the first thing we need to do is include in the official uk guidance about nutrition the information that ultra processed foods are associated with weight gain and diet related diseases, and that the recommendation for people is to avoid these foods. many countries like brazil and france already do this.\n",
      "limiting the marketing of ultra processed foods is essential. we need to learn the lessons from regulating the tobacco industry and stop predatory companies selling this food to people.\n",
      "we also need to change the ultra processed institutional food that we serve in hospitals, schools, and prisons. there is very good evidence that when feeding patients and staff in hospitals, real food is hugely beneficial.\n",
      "there are also misconceptions we need to address. for instance, people who live with diet related diseases, especially obesity, usually have a strong feeling of guilt, thinking they are the problem due to their own lack of willpower. researchers now know this isn't true. this food has been engineered to be addictive. we need to shift the blame away from the population.\n",
      "normally, we would blame the food companies and demand change from them. but when you speak to people in any of those companies it's very clear that they are unable to change. danone is the best example of this. its previous ceo, emmanuel faber, tried to turn the company into a social enterprise by stopping the sale of ultra processed food and increasing the environmental portfolio. the share price tanked, activist investors threw him out, and danone had no option but to go back to its previous business model. all the big transnational food corporations are answerable to their owners. if we don't understand this financial loop, we will keep shouting at companies that cannot change their business model. what we have to understand is that the responsibility lies with governments. they need a mandate from their population to change the regulations.\n",
      "another group of people whom we don't criticize enough are the doctors, who have a very long history of partnering with transnational food corporations and supplement providers to mislead people. most nutrition research is funded by the food industry and that's clearly wrong.\n",
      "anyone who's struggling with this as an individual should take their guilt and shame and transfer it outwardly to the corporations that are feeding us these addictive substances, to the governments doing nothing about it, and to the physicians and the social media personalities who keep telling us that this stuff is healthy. we need to end the conflict of interest between the industry and politicians, doctors and scientists. only then can we really tackle the problem.\n",

      "URL: https://www.wired.com/story/states-with-abortion-bans-are-losing-a-generation-of-ob-gyns/\n",
      "Author(s): Maryn McKenna\n",
      "Title: States With Abortion Bans Are Losing a Generation of Ob-Gyns\n",
      "fishbach was in michigan, where an abortion ban enacted in 1931 instantly came into effect. that law made administering an abortion a felony punishable by four years in prison, with no exceptions for rape or incest. it was a chilling moment: her residency is in obstetrics and gynecology, and she viewed mastering abortion procedures as essential to her training.\n",
      "\"i suspected during my application cycle that this could happen, and to receive confirmation of it was devastating,\" she recalls. \"but i had strategically applied where i thought that, even if i didn't receive the full spectrum, i would at least have the support and the resources to get myself to an institution that would train me.\"\n",
      "her mind whirled through the possibilities. would her program help its residents go to an access protecting state? could she broker an agreement to go somewhere on her own, arranging weeks of extra housing and obtaining a local medical license and insurance? would she still earn her salary if she left her program—and how would she fund her life if she did not?\n",
      "in the end, she didn't need to leave. that november, michigan voters approved an amendment to the state constitution that made the 1931 law unenforceable, and this april, governor gretchen whitmer repealed the ban. fishbach didn't have to abandon the state to learn the full range of ob gyn care. in fact, her program at the university of michigan, where she's now a second year resident, pivoted to making room for red state trainees.\n",
      "but the dizzying reassessment she underwent a year ago provides a glimpse of the challenges that face thousands of new and potential doctors. almost 45 percent of the 286 accredited ob gyn programs in the us now operate under revived or new abortion bans, meaning that more than 2,000 residents per year—trainee doctors who have committed to the specialty—may not receive the required training to be licensed. among students and residents, simmering anger over bans is growing. long time faculty fear the result will be a permanent reshaping of american medicine, driving new doctors from red states to escape limitations and legal threats, or to protect their own reproductive options. that would reduce the number of physicians available, not just to provide abortions, but to conduct genetic screenings, care for miscarriages, deliver babies, and handle unpredictable pregnancy risks.\n",
      "\"i worry that we're going to see an increase in maternal morbidity, differentially, depending on where you live,\" says kate shaw, a physician and associate chair of ob gyn education at stanford medicine. \"and that's just going to further enhance disparities that already exist.\"\n",
      "those effects are not yet visible. the pipeline that ushers medical graduates through physician training is about a decade long: four years of school plus three to seven years of residency, sometimes with a two year, sub specialty fellowship afterward. thus actions taken in response to the dobbs decision—people eschewing red state schools or choosing to settle in blue states long term—might take a while to be noticeable.\n",
      "but in this year, some data has emerged that suggests trends to come. in february, a group of students, residents and faculty surveyed 2,063 licensed and trainee physicians and found that 82 percent want to work or train in states that retain abortion access—and 76 percent would refuse to apply in states that restrict it. (the respondents worked in a mix of specialties; for those whose work would include performing abortions, the proportion intending to work where it remains legal soared above 99 percent.)\n",
      "then in april, a study from the association of american medical colleges drawing on the first round of applications to residency programs after dobbs found that ob gyn applications in states with abortion restrictions sank by 10 percent compared to the previous year. applications to all ob gyn programs dropped by 5 percent. (nationwide, all applications to residency went down 2 percent from 2021 to 2022.)\n",
      "last month, two preliminary pieces of research presented at the annual meeting of the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists uncovered more perturbations. in texas—where the restrictive law sb8 went into effect in september 2021, nine months before dobbs—a multi year upward trend in applications to ob gyn residency slowed after the law passed. and in an unrelated national survey, 77 percent of 494 thirdand fourth year medical students said that abortion restrictions would affect where they applied to residency, while 58 percent said they were unlikely to apply to states with a ban.\n",
      "that last survey was conducted by ariana traub and kellen \"nell\" mermin bunnell, two third year medical students at emory university school of medicine in atlanta—which lies within a state with a \"fetal heartbeat\" law that predates dobbs and that criminalizes providing an abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. the law means that students in clinical rotations are unlikely to witness abortions and would not be allowed to discuss the procedure with patients. it also means that, if either of them were to become pregnant while at med school, they would not have that option themselves.\n",
      "before they published the survey, the two friends conducted an analysis of how bans would affect medical school curricula, using data collected in the summer of 2022. they predicted that only 29 percent of the more than 129,000 medical students in the us would not be affected by state bans. the survey gave them a chance to sample med students' feelings about those developments, with the help of faculty members. they also founded a nonprofit, georgia healthcare professionals for reproductive justice. \"we're in a unique position, as individuals in the health care field but not necessarily medical professionals yet,\" traub says. \"we have some freedom. so we felt like we had to use that power to try to make change.\"\n",
      "the conflict between what medicine demands and state laws prevent leaves new and would be doctors in restrictive states struggling with their inability to follow medical evidence and their own best intentions. \"i'm starting to take care of patients for the first time in my life,\" says mermin bunnell, traub's survey partner. \"seeing a human being in front of you, who needs your help, and not being able to help them or even talk to them about what their options might be—it feels morally wrong.\"\n",
      "that frustration is equally evident among trainees in specialties who might treat a pregnant person, prescribe treatments that could imperil a pregnancy, or care for a pregnancy gone wrong. those include family and adolescent medicine, anesthesiology, radiology, rheumatology, even dermatology and mental health.\n",
      "\"i'm particularly interested in oncology, and i've come to realize that you can't have the full standard of gynecologic oncology care without being able to have access to abortion care,\" says morgan levy, a fourth year medical student in florida who plans to apply to ob gyn residency. florida currently bans abortion after 15 weeks; a further ban, down to six weeks, passed in april but has been held up by legal challenges. in three years of med school so far, levy received one lecture on abortion—in the context of miscarriage—and no clinical exposure to the procedure. \"it is a priority for me to make sure that i get trained,\" she says.\n",
      "but landing in a training program that encourages abortion practice is more difficult than it looks. residency application is an algorithm driven process in which graduates list their preferred programs, and faculty rank the trainees they want to teach. for years, there have been more applicants than there are spaces—and this year, as in the past, ob gyn programs filled almost all their slots. what that means, according to faculty members, is that some applicants will end up where they do not want to be.\n",
      "\"students and trainees do exert their preferences, but they also need to get a training spot,\" says vineet arora, the dean for medical education at the university of chicago pritzker school of medicine and lead author on the survey published in february. \"would they forgo a training spot because of dobbs? that's a tall order, especially in a competitive field. but would they be happy about it? and would they want to stay there long term?\"\n",
      "that is not a hypothetical question. according to the medical colleges association, more than half of residents stay to practice in the states where they trained. but it's reasonable to ask whether they would feel that loyalty if they were deprived of training or forced to relocate. \"if even a portion of the 80 percent of people who prefer to practice and train in states that don't have abortion bans follow through on those preferences, those states that are putting in abortion bans—which often have workforce shortages already—will be in a worse situation,\" arora says.\n",
      "an acog analysis estimated in 2017 that half of us counties, which are home to 10 million women, have no practicing ob gyn. when the health care tech firm doximity examined ob gyn workloads in 2019, seven of the 10 cities it identified as having the highest workloads lie in what are now very restrictive states. those shortages are likely to worsen if new doctors relocate to states where they feel safe. the legal and consulting firm manatt health predicted in a white paper last fall: \"the impact on access to all ob/gyn care in certain geographies could be catastrophic.\"\n",
      "steinauer directs the kenneth j. ryan residency training program, a 24 year old effort to install and reinforce clinical abortion training. even before dobbs, that was hard to come by: in 2018, steinauer and colleagues estimated that only two thirds of ob gyn residency programs made it routine, despite accreditation requirements—and that anywhere from 29 to 78 percent of residents couldn't competently perform different types of abortion when they left training. in 2020, researchers from ucsf and uc berkeley documented that 57 percent of these programs face limitations set by individual hospitals more extreme than those set by states.\n",
      "before dobbs, the ryan program brokered individual relocations that let trainees temporarily transfer to other institutions. now it is working to set up program to program agreements instead, because the logistics required to visit for a rotation—the kind of arrangements fishbach dizzily imagined a year ago—are more complex than most people can manage on their own. and not only on the visiting trainee: programs already perform delicate calculations of how many trainees they can take given the number of patients coming to their institutions and the number of faculty mentors.\n",
      "only a few places have managed to institutionalize \"away rotations,\" in which they align accreditation milestones, training time, and financing with other institutions. oregon health & science university's school of medicine is about to open a formal program that will accept 10 to 12 residents from restrictive states for a month each over a year. oregon imposes no restrictions on abortion, and both the med school's existing residents and the university's philanthropic foundation supported the move.\n",
      "\"i'm very concerned about having a future generation that knows how to provide safe abortion care—because abortion will never go away; becoming illegal only makes it less safe,\" says alyssa colwill, who oversees the new program and is an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology. \"there are going to be patients that are going to use unsafe methods because there's no other alternative. and providers are going to be placed in scenarios that are heartbreaking, and are devastating to watch.\"\n",
      "this isn't imaginary: already, research has shown that physicians practicing in red states are less likely to offer appropriate and legal procedures to treat miscarriages. receiving abortion training, in other words, also improves medical care for pregnancy loss.\n",
      "\"ultimately, i do not think there is capacity to train every resident who wants training,\" says charisse loder, a clinical assistant professor of ob gyn at the university of michigan medical school, who directs the program where fishbach is training. \"so we will have ob gyn residents who are not trained in this care. and i think that is not only unfortunate, but puts patients in a position of being cared for by residents who don't have comprehensive training.\"\n",
      "doing only short rotations also returns residents to places where their own reproductive health could be put at risk. future physicians are likely to be older than in previous generations, having been encouraged to get life experience and sample other careers before entering med school. research on which levy and arora collaborated in 2022 shows that more than 11 percent of new physicians had abortions during their training. because of the length of training, they also may be more likely to use ivf when they are ready to start families—and some reproductive technologies may be criminalized under current abortion bans.\n",
      "as a fourth and final year psychiatry resident, simone bernstein had thought about abortion restrictions through the lens of her patients' mental health, as she talked to them about fertility treatment and pregnancy loss. as cofounder of the online platform inside the match, she had listened to residents' reactions to dobbs (and collaborated on research with levy and arora). she had not expected the decision to affect her personally—but she is in missouri, a state where there is an almost complete ban on abortion. and this spring, she experienced a miscarriage at 13 weeks of pregnancy.\n",
      "\"i was worried whether or not i could even go to the hospital, if my baby still had a heartbeat, which was a conversation that i had to have with my ob gyn on the phone,\" she says. \"it didn't come to that; i caught the baby in my hands at home, hemorrhaging blood everywhere, and the baby had already passed away. but until that moment, i didn't recognize the effects that [abortion restrictions] could have on me.\"\n",
      "this is the reality now: there exist very few places in the us where abortion is uncomplicated. faculty and their trainees do not expect that to change, except for the worse. staying in the field, and making sure the next generation is prepared, requires commitment that they will have to sustain for years.\n",
      "\"part of the reason why i sought advanced training in abortion and contraception is because i think there will be a national ban,\" says abigail liberty, an ob gyn and fellow in her sixth postgraduate year at ohsu. \"i think it will happen in our lifetime. and i see my role as getting as much expertise and training as i can now and providing care while i can. and then coming out of retirement, when abortion will be legal again, and training the next generation of physicians.\" \n",

      "Author(s): Elissaveta M. Brandon\n",
      "Title: Ryuichi Sakamoto’s Final Performance Is a Virtual-Only Engagement\n",
      "the performance lasts about 45 minutes. the oscar winning composer plays 10 of his own compositions, and at the end of every piece, people clap. not me at first, but i make up for it with tears, which first build up in my throat, then stream down my cheeks. when it's over, sakamoto doesn't bow and walk off the stage; he passed away in march this year after a years long battle with cancer. he just fades into black as i take off the headset i am wearing.\n",
      "kagami, as the music performance is called, is a mixed reality show on view through july 9 at the shed in manhattan and at factory international in manchester, with runs at the sydney opera house and the big ears festival in knoxville, tennessee, up next. the show begins with 80 people sitting in a circle around absolutely nothing. after each concertgoer has slid on a magic leap 2 headset, a virtual sakamoto appears in the center of the circle. the musician then performs as you mosey \"around\" him, being ever so careful not to bump into a piano that doesn't exist—or your fellow attendees, who do.\n",
      "kagami—japanese for \"mirror\"—was designed by the production studio tin drum, and fuses a 3d model of sakamoto with the real world, resulting in an experience that feels material and ethereal at once. it is part of an ever growing cohort of musical experimentations with ar and vr. in the thick of the pandemic in 2020, billie eilish performed a livestreamed concert jazzed up with extended reality effects that turned the stage into a gloomy ocean floor and a star studded sky. in 2022, gorillaz took over new york's times square, then london's piccadilly circus, as ar technology brought the band's characters to life on giant screens. the list goes on to include ariana grande, justin bieber, and travis scott, most of whom started to dabble with mixed reality during the pandemic.\n",
      "fast forward to november 2020, and both men flew from new york city, where they were based, to locked down tokyo, one of only two cities in the world with the setup necessary to capture sakamoto in 3d and generate a virtual model of him using volumetric and motion capture technology. the session lasted three days, during which sakamoto played his compositions under the scrutiny of 48 cameras, various microphones, and lightboxes.\n",
      "there was nothing glamorous about it: every surface around him, piano included, was covered in green—\"kermit land,\" jokes eckert. sakamoto was wearing lentil sized motion capture markers on his face, with almost 20 of them strategically taped to the back of his hands. his thin silver hair, which normally falls over his forehead, was waxed back and held under a net so it didn't hide his facial expressions from the cameras. \"in service of making something authentic you have to go through impossible odds and processes that seem inauthentic,\" says eckert.\n",
      "it took about six months for eckert's team to process the raw data captured in the session. in the meantime, they also had to sculpt sakamoto's hair from scratch and recreate his iconic glasses. but the most challenging thing to recreate was sakamoto's face, which was blocked from the cameras for a large part of his performance because he was hunched over.\n",
      "maybe that's because the morning before the first session started, sakamoto had learned the cancer was back, and it was everywhere. \"i didn't find out what he had found out until a year and a half later,\" says eckert, conjecturing that maybe sakamoto knew he was going to die soon, so he was leaning over the piano more than usual. \"these are the slowest versions of these songs he ever did,\" says eckert.\n",
      "because the team had inconsistent data of sakamoto's face, both in form and texture, they had to make up for the missing data by reconstructing his face using referencing segments of complete data. it took months.\n",
      "meanwhile, separate teams were working on a series of 3d artworks that would end up accompanying the performance: gentle fog that curls around everyone's ankles for the opening piece; a tree that draws itself on top of the piano a bit later. \"it was never my intention to simply service people who knew they loved ryuichi, but to try to expand the audience that would come to understand his work,\" says eckert. luckily, the artworks elevate the performance instead of detracting from it. while sakamoto is playing the hit track \"energy flow,\" for example, a window opens high above him, and snowflakes start floating through it. the snow effect references akira kurosawa's 1952 film ikiru, where the main character—an elderly man who knows he will die soon—spends his final moments sitting on a park swing during a snowfall, singing a romantic ballad.\n",
      "the entire show feels otherworldly, but there's only so much technology can achieve. the magic leap 2 has a 70 degree field of view, which is twice as big as the previous iteration, but it still means that when you look up at the ceiling to see that window, you can no longer see sakamoto. the headset is also tricky to get used to, considering you're walking around in a room full of strangers wearing the equivalent of dark sunglasses. (the magic leap 2 comes with a dimming feature that allows real objects to slip behind virtual ones, but the illusion was so strong that people kept bumping into each other at test shows, so the team had to disable it.)\n",
      "surreal as it was, the performance left me somewhat puzzled. can a mixed reality concert ever make up for the sad reality of someone's absence? i have never seen sakamoto play live, but i doubt kagami comes close to the palpable energy of his presence in the room. what do we lose when technology becomes so integral to the most intimate of human experiences—and what do we gain?\n",
      "indre viskontas, a neuroscientist and operatic soprano who serves on the faculty at the san francisco conservatory of music, says that knowing who wrote the piece can affect how people experience it too. in 2013, a team of researchers ran a neuroimaging study in which they asked people to lie in a scanner and listen to a piece of music that was the same for everyone. one half was told the music was composed by a human, and the other half was told it was composed by a machine. the first group, viskontas says, engaged a part of the brain that helps us understand how other people feel, think, and behave. in other words, when people knew the composer was human, they had more empathy. \"one of the things we do as humans is try to understand, 'what is that human being trying to tell me, what are their beliefs, are they friend or foe?' and we do that by essentially trying to put ourselves in the shoes of that person,\" viskontas says.\n",
      "viskontas acknowledges that the same study might yield different results if it were performed today, when our culture is steeped in ai generated music and art. it's also a bit different considering sakamoto was human, and was performing his own songs for the recording—it was just his presence that was relayed through a machine. but according to viskontas, the connection the public forms with him in mixed reality can only work if we buy into the illusion of a performer in the room, playing the piano—and if the technology is advanced enough to help us convince ourselves that it is real.\n",
      "the latter may take a while. as outlined in a 2016 study, in order for vr technology to truly make us feel like we are present in a room with a performer and an audience, it needs to better translate subtle physical changes in the performer like blushing and sweating, or almost imperceptible things like the raising of an eyebrow. it would also have to give us the option of physical contact with those around us. replicating the unique energy and atmosphere that stems from the collective presence of performers and the audience being in the venue together is another challenge. this is only partly addressed in kagami, which may be designed for a small crowd to take in together, but remains a mostly solitary experience.\n",
      "still, the show remains a captivating attempt at capturing the impossible and freezing it in time. with no room for improv, sakamoto will display the exact same emotions every single time the performance runs. will the magic fade away if i go back a second time?\n",
      "perhaps sakamoto knew the stakes. reflecting on kagami in early 2023, shortly before his death, he wrote: \"there is, in reality, a virtual me. this virtual me will not age, and will continue to play the piano for years, decades, centuries ... will there be empathy there? empathy that spans hundreds of thousands of years. ah, but the batteries won't last that long.\" \n",

the fire max 11 delivers what amazon is promising, which is to say it's by far the best fire tablet the company has ever made.the 11 inch lcd screen has a nice 2,000 x 1,200 pixel resolution that's quite glare prone, but no worse than other tablets. the 16:9 format signals that the first priority here is consuming movies (and reading, if you rotate to portrait mode), but it's not great for productivity. it could be if amazon updated fire os to access some of the tools in android 12l, which is optimized for tablets, but fire os is based on an outdated version of android that lacks any tablet friendly features. more on that in a minute.there's a fingerprint reader on the side power button, which is a first for a fire tablet. a microsd slot lets you expand your media storage, and the keyboard now connects via pogo pins, which allow it to charge and communicate. previous fire tablets—like mine—need to connect to keyboards via bluetooth, which is inconsistent and slow on the best of days and must be charged separately. the fire max 11 also supports wi fi 6 and has front and rear 8 megapixel cameras, making it better for video chats as well.under the screen sit 4 gigabytes of ram and either a 64 gigabyte or 128 gigabyte ssd (the larger storage adds another $50). the max 11 is powered by a mediatek mt8188j chip, which uses an 8 core processor. those specs put the fire max 11 in the middle of most android tablets—more powerful than its fire siblings, but certainly not close to any oneplus or pixel tablet. for amazon though, this qualifies as a high end slate, relative to the rest of the fire lineup.amazon fire max 11rating: 5/10$230 at amazon$330 at amazon (productivity bundle)if you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. this helps support our journalism. learn more. please also consider subscribing to wiredit's made of metal and feels much nicer than any other fire device. after using it for several weeks, i was a little sad to go back to my plasticky fire 10. the fire max 11 is also noticeably faster in performance, though not enough that i would feel compelled to upgrade. one potential deal breaker is that the keyboard and case are not self supporting. to be productive with the productivity bundle, you need to put the whole thing on a flat surface.the keyboard, while usable, is on the small side. i had a lot of trouble with the trackpad, which kept clicking things when i accidentally brushed it with my palms while typing. it's not an insurmountable issue, but it's more annoying than it should be at this price. the stylus is laughably bad. luckily for users, there are almost no apps in the amazon app store that would make you want to use the stylus.prime timephotograph: amazonthe core problem with the fire max 11 is that it's just not good enough for the money amazon is charging. if you want to use it for anything more than a firehose blasting your eyeballs with prime content, you'll have to spend $330. given that you can get a 9th generation ipad on amazon for roughly $279 and a bluetooth keyboard for $30 more, why would anyone buy a fire max 11? i don't know.it's an ok tablet, but it's nowhere near as powerful as even the base model ipad, the pixel tablet, the oneplus pad, or the second generation of lenovo's tab p11 pro. most of these tablets cost more, yes, but they're better investments for all but the most diehard amazon fan (if such people exist).the reason you should buy something else comes down to software. fire os, amazon's proprietary fork of android, is terrible. it's always been terrible, and as far as i can tell, it will always be terrible. its sole purpose is to deliver your eyeballs to amazon. it works well for that. you'll have no trouble finding all your favorite amazon prime features and perks through fire os.if you want to do anything else, you'll find yourself fighting fire os to get it done. there are no google apps and no play store, only the limited offerings of amazon's app store. i did try to install the play store using my own instructions, but so far i have not been able to get it working. i will update that guide as soon as i figure it out, but lenovo's tab p11 pro is still a better investment for roughly the same price.amazon fire max 11rating: 5/10$230 at amazon$330 at amazon (productivity bundle)if you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. this helps support our journalism. learn more. please also consider subscribing to wired$230 at amazon$330 at amazon (productivity bundle) \n",

      "Title: Video Game Remakes Are in a Golden Age. That Could Be a Bad Thing\n",
      "the line comes early in the game, right after our coiffured all american hero has seen his police escort burned alive. leon is about to be butchered by pitchfork and chainsaw wielding spanish farmers, but then a tolling bell suddenly psychically summons them away. the line is amazingly stupid, and if he doesn't say it, i thought after seeing news of the demo, i'm joining the mob outside the capcom offices. (reader, rest assured, the villagers attended bingo.)\n",
      "the culture industry loves a remake; it also loves a reboot, a remaster, a sequel, a prequel, a multiverse, and a cinematic universe. in a recent long read for vulture, writers josef adalian and lane brown warned that tv is headed into an era of \"safe ideas,\" comparing the times to come to the movie industry of the 2010s. brand recognition and cultural stagnation await; harry potter and twilight series are in the works. other media also run the risk of falling into this same trap; that's the danger with sure things.\n",
      "of course, there is nothing inherently debased about remakes. no remakes, no scarface or true grit; in a broad sense, shakespeare made a career of it. it is a censorious and misguided impulse to claim that a remake undermines its subject. you might find it harder to convince someone to watch the original wicker man if they've just sat through nick cage hollering about bees (not me, that movie rocks), but in general, this logic is weird math. where there was one, now there are two. a remake is just an interpretation—it should not replace the original.\n",
      "but for video games, the math is often a subtraction. so far this year, studios have reimagined four classic games (to varying degrees of change) brilliantly: resident evil 4, metroid prime, dead space, and, most recently, system shock, possibly heralding a remake golden age.\n",
      "contrary to other artforms, there is a tendency in the games industry to talk about remakes as replacements. this is not to say that the history of film and literature isn't also riddled with innumerable losses, great works burned up in disasters or walled off on obscure streaming platforms. but with video games, where old versions get swapped out for the new ones on platforms like steam or the playstation store, the replacement of the original work is particularly baked into the process. and a remake is not a replacement, no matter how superior.\n",
      "in this vein, one type of remake is a simple \"remaster,\" like metroid prime, which sharpened the graphics to meet fans' nostalgia filtered memories. this kind of upgrade is often enough to impress punters: bluepoint studios beautified demon's souls to such an extent that it supposedly put pressure on the graphics team working on elden ring.\n",
      "but there are deeper ways a developer can remake a game. mark brown of the game maker's toolkit broke these down recently in a youtube video about the resident evil 4 reboot titled \"why capcom is the king of remakes.\" the first is \"modernization,\" adding newer gameplay concepts like fast travel and quicksave. the second is addressing criticism: the artist gets to go back and fix all the inevitable galling failures that make revisiting art so painful. (if only writers could do this with their pieces.) and the final is accessibility. sometimes making goals easier or clearer; other times it means adding in options for disabled players. brown argued that by accomplishing all three, capcom made re4 feel fresh to old fans and neophytes alike.\n",
      "but crucially, brown points out, the original resident evil 4 is still available. not so for titles like warcraft iii: reforged and the remake of grand theft auto: san andreas, both of which erased their previous iterations in favor of inferior remasters. this conundrum grows out of the public's relationship with consumer technologies. games are tied to the development of tech like processors and gpus; this means that games are also tied to the false vision of technological progress as a straight line of continuous improvement rather than a chaotic series of hit or miss implementations. video games often seem rooted in hype and obsoletion cycles, to be swept away like old iphones or social media accounts. (in this sense, games mirror the lack of preservation that exists across the internet broadly.)\n",
      "the less apparent baked in assumption here is that games are consistently improving, rather than passing through different artistic styles and trends. this idea differs from the mindset of players who see the original as a sacred text, and get annoyed at the most minor changes in lore or voice actors. but we do not think literature improves like science, and advancements in cgi have not improved films. watch nosferatu (now being remade by robert eggers) and you'll see f. w. murnau did just fine adapting bram stoker's dracula before the advent of sound and color.\n",
      "so artistic quality does not necessarily improve in lockstep with technology. but in games, there is a tendency to equate the new with better. yet, playing these four recent remakes, i was shocked by how the things that had survived felt so good: their \"linear\" worlds did not feel old fashioned. they fomented a desire to play the reboot and the original—and a hope that i will always be able to do both. \n",

      "in a new research paper, economists looked at the job market across a number of european countries between 2011 and 2019. that's the period during which the ai technique deep learning emerged as a powerful way to automate tasks like transcribing speech, analyzing images, and making algorithmic recommendations for social feeds and ecommerce sites. back then, deep learning was widely expected to have a broad and swift impact on employment.\n",
      "to check up on what really happened, researchers at the european central bank, spain's central bank, and the universities of oxford and pittsburgh used two established methods for measuring how vulnerable professions are to ai powered automation. both involved examining the tasks workers do and how they compare with the capabilities of algorithms. the researchers cross referenced that information with survey data on eu workers that shows the number of people leaving or joining different occupations in industries ranging from agriculture to financial services.\n",
      "the headline result was that industries where ai could be the most useful did not see a reduction of jobs. in fact, for more highly skilled jobs vulnerable to ai, such as white collar office work that involves working with data, there was around a 5 percent increase in the number of employed workers. the researchers say this supports the idea that new technology can increase demand for more skilled workers at the same time that it replaces those who do routine work. less skilled workers didn't seem to be significantly affected by software or ai.\n",
      "although fears about new technologies taking jobs are common—and entirely understandable—economic research offers a complex, mixed picture. in general, many economists believe that automation can increase demand for jobs overall, as shown by some recent studies. if you are not one of those more skilled workers, however, the arrival of new technology might be a problem.\n",
      "none of this research makes it possible to predict what effect chatgpt or other generative ai technologies will have. they may be too new to cause noticeable changes. and it's possible that generative ai has an entirely different effect on jobs to what came before. \"while in the period of our analysis the association is positive, these results may not be extrapolated into the future,\" the authors of the new study write.\n",
      "generative ai is undeniably already causing some disruption. you don't have to look far to find stories of individuals and businesses that are already being changed by the kind of ai behind chatgpt.\n",
      "some copywriters, for instance, are having to find new careers after customers replaced them with generative ai tools. a number of publications are also experimenting with ai generated content. the german tabloid bild recently cited ai as one reason for planned job cuts.\n",
      "but let's not forget that tools like chatgpt are still unreliable coworkers, as they make up facts, reinforce biases, and can otherwise misbehave. and it's worth remembering that the emergence of deep learning in the 2010s prompted some ai experts to predict the elimination of certain jobs, including radiologists—a prognostication that has hardly come true. \n",

      "Title: Could a Dutch apology for empire and slavery set a royal trend?\n",
      "is late truly better than never?  when king willem alexander of the netherlands commemorates the 160th anniversary of the country's abolition of slavery on saturday (july 1), he is widely expected to apologize for the dutch imperial slave trade. the weight of history is bearing down on the king. for decades campaigners in former dutch colonies in the caribbean have called on the netherlands to apologize and pay reparations for the brutal and systematic trade in human lives in the 17th and 18th centuries.  the netherlands' reckoning with its past comes as some in europe grapple with the realities of their brutal colonial and slave holding history. an apology, which is widely expected, would pile pressure on the royal families of britain, belgium and other former slave trading european nations to do the same. the dutch royal palace said it does not comment on the king's upcoming speeches. still, anything short of an apology would cause uproar among activists. in december prime minister mark rutte apologized on behalf of the dutch government to the descendants of enslaved people. and on june 15, the sheer extent of dutch colonial enslavement was laid bare in a new government funded academic study called state and slavery that forensically tells the story of how the small north sea nation became a world leading economy in large part through its exploitation of forced labor. the netherlands' vast, lucrative network of human trafficking saw hundreds of thousands of people stolen from africa and sold in the caribbean and east asia — something that until now has not been widely known by the country's citizens, according to the study. it also doesn't fit the popular image of holland — as many netherlanders still call it — as a multicultural and tolerant democracy with a modern bicycle riding royal family. the study also describes how the king's predecessors made the equivalent of almost $600 million from the slave trade, having invested nothing at the trade's height in the 17th and 18th centuries, more than 1,000 enslaved people were taken to suriname every year to work on sugar plantations, according to state and slavery.  more than 90% of the population in what was then a south american colony were enslaved and conditions were so harsh that the number of births never outpaced the number of deaths, the study showed. the study's findings have surprised many in the netherlands, including those who read advance copies, said one of its editors, esther captain, an expert at the royal netherlands institute of southeast asian and caribbean studies, in the dutch city of leiden. \"i was shocked because you would assume that [it is] basic in general knowledge, but it's not,\" she told nbc news by telephone. \"i think it is to do with the fact that this is confronting our self image. we used to sell ourselves as tolerant, open minded and democratic. and i think this is challenging our very self image, and that hurts.\" the church, the navy and the royal family each played a part in the human trafficking of an estimated 600,000 people, mainly to suriname and the antilles islands in the caribbean. successive generations were born into this often deadly cycle of servitude.  plantation owners busied themselves with reading, writing, sports and other leisure pursuits as workers toiled in the hot sun while facing physical and sexual abuse. the dutch began trading slaves in the 1500s and became a major player in the 1600s. slavery only ended in the dutch caribbean islands and suriname in 1863 — although some slaves were not freed for another 10 years. the netherlands relented in the face of international pressure, not least from britain, which ended its part in the atlantic slave trade in 1808. (the united states abolished slavery in 1865.) slavery was also enforced in the dutch east indies — a major colony that included modern day indonesia — until the 19th century. in response to questions from nbc news, pauline van voorst, a spokesperson for the dutch government, echoed rutte's apology in admitting the country had too late in acting on the legacy of slavery.  \"for centuries, under dutch state authority, human dignity was violated in the most horrific way possible. and successive dutch governments after 1863 failed to adequately see and acknowledge that our slavery past continued to have negative effects and still does,\" she said. on the question of reparations, she said that various assistance packages were already in place to help former colonies, designed to improve local economies.  the state and slavery project was funded by a 200 million euro (about $218 million) commission to explore and expose the country's colonial past, announced by rutte in december. some countries have made similar moves and even paid reparations. king charles iii said in april that buckingham palace will cooperate with research into the british royalty's links to slavery, and belgium set up a commission to study its links in 2020. belgian lawmakers spent hours last year debating whether and how to make an apology but came to no agreement, and the british project is not due to complete until 2026.  belgium's king philippe expressed his \"deepest regrets\" last june while on a trip to the democratic republic of the congo, where from 1885 to 1908 the government, under the supervision of king leopold ii, extracted a fortune in natural resources while enslaving, maiming, torturing and killing many thousands of people. britain has \"fallen behind the international conversation\" in owning up to its colonial past, said sathnam sanghera, a journalist and author of \"empireland,\" a bestselling 2021 book about the legacy of british colonialism.  \"that the dutch have commissioned historians and given an apology just highlights how little we've done,\" he said. king charles' coronation, which included items glittering with precious gems taken from british colonies, underlined britain's imperial past. \"it kept coming up during the coronation, every other commonwealth was raising it, whether it was loot, slavery or the legacy of it,\" sanghera said. \"this is going to be the conversation for the next 20 years.\" britain was an early and enthusiastic participant in the transatlantic slave trade in the 16th and 17th centuries, which helped build an empire that reigned over some 400 million inhabitants at its height in the early 20th century. in 2021, germany called its actions in namibia \"genocide\" and pledged 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in reparations, and the same year french president emmanuel macron apologized to algerians who fought alongside french forces but were later killed as traitors. \"you have germany doing that, you have the netherlands doing that. and it pressures belgium, who have kind of stuck their heels in the sand,\" said jeremiah garsha, an expert in colonial history at university college dublin. the state and slavery project made headlines last week for revealing how much money dutch kings made from slavery. but garsha added that reducing an entire country's colonial misdeeds to a number is in itself a continuation of the colonial attitude: that people can be financial assets. \"those are numbers that continue to kind of enslave people in our mindset — they're chattel, they're property. no. these are experiences, these are human experiences,\" he said. \"that's what i want to recover.\" \n",

      "Title: Train carrying hazardous materials derails and bridge collapses into Montana river\n",
      "a train carrying hazardous materials derailed and a bridge collapsed into a southern montana river saturday, sending rail cars into the water and prompting concerns about contamination.  some of those fears may have been allayed by evening as rail officials said two cars known to be carrying sodium hydro sulfate, which can burn, irritate and cause shortness of breath, had not entered the yellowstone river below the failed bridge.  no hazardous materials were released from those particular rail cars, said andy garland, a spokesperson for montana rail link.  but an unspecified number of other cars containing molten sulfur and asphalt had been \"compromised,\" he said in a statement. officials will continue to monitor the derailment site, he said. no injuries were reported, officials said.  as many as eight cars derailed, columbus, montana, fire chief rich cowger told nbc affiliate kulr of billings. billings said in a statement that it would shut down city water system intakes fed by the yellowstone river for the time any pollutant would need to pass and end up downstream. billings, a city of nearly 110,000 people, has a clean supply of drinking water in its system, including storage tanks that are full, it said. laurel, montana, suspended its intake from the river and temporarily shut down its water treatment plant saturday morning, but a few hours later it reconnected its supply and restarted treatment, officials said in a statement. laurel officials visited the derailment site and investigated the water system, the statement said. water treatment plants in yellowstone county were working as normal as officials monitored the river for any signs of contaminants, county officials said in a statement. \"at this time there have been no reported negative impacts to yellowstone county,\" its government said in a statement. the train derailed and the bridge collapsed about 6 a.m. near the community of reed point, said officials in stillwater county, which abuts yellowstone county. the bridge over the yellowstone river was described as a rail bridge in the statement saturday. the national transportation safety board said in a statement saturday evening that it is sending an investigative team to the derailment site. the federal railroad administration is leading the inquiry, the ntsb said. it was not immediately clear whether the collapse or the derailment happened first or what caused either.  asphalt contains carcinogens, and it has been linked to some forms of cancer. molten sulfur can cause serious thermal burns upon contact and will form toxic and flammable gases when it reacts to hydrocarbon, a compound at the heart of fossil fuels. \n",

      "Title: The 'moment has arrived' for digital creators. And they're here for it.\n",
      "anaheim, calif. — as vidcon has matured in recent years, so too have its attendees.  this year the annual conference — for creators, fans and industry execs — brought together the likes of hollywood a list star keke palmer and youtube minecraft streamer dream. it also featured such panels as \"the new era of celebrity\" and \"stream to mainstream: hollywood's new rules of engagement.\" online content — often dismissed as less impressive or serious than traditional media — is proving to be an unignorable force in entertainment as the lines between digital, film and tv continue to blur. \"i mean, this in the nicest way,\" ian hecox, co founder of og youtube comedy channel smosh, said. vidcon has \"gone from weirdos to entrepreneurs.\" young people have increasingly turned to online video for entertainment. during the pandemic lockdown in 2020, digital content on platforms like youtube and tiktok dominated, which experts at vidcon said helped propel digital media as a serious form of entertainment.  \"we're not on a journey anymore,\" said amber tarshis, chief marketing officer at creator economy startup jellysmack. \"the moment has arrived. digital first talent are the power players today.\" with everyone at home, audiences ran out of new shows to watch on tv or stream, but creators kept people entertained with fresh content everyday.  \"it really drove people into watching creators, not as a hobby thing but as another linear option,\" said joe gagliese, ceo of viral nation, an influencer marketing and talent management company.   gagliese said that when he co founded viral nation in 2014, many creators believed that the next step in their careers had to be crossing over to mainstream media.  but creators are no longer just using social media as a jumping off point for bigger stardom. instead, online content is the end goal. over the years, content creation has become a serious and feasible career option for many. \"they all thought that the natural evolution of being a creator was becoming a celebrity,\" gagliese said. \"as the years went on, and some of them made the crossover and realized, 'i gotta go work a 13 hour day for 1,200 bucks and they don't care who i am.' ... so they realize that like, that's a whole different grind than what they're used to.\" the transition from digital to mainstream media has not always been smooth, partly because executives have tried to force traditional growth models onto new age talent. in general, the relationship between digital talent and the hollywood executives who invest in them has been fraught in the past. creators felt many people coming from the traditional entertainment industry didn't \"get\" the internet.  hecox and anthony padilla, co creators of smosh, can attest to this. the duo, who recently reunited after splitting up in 2017 to buy the brand back, has experienced the different phases and investments in the creator space since the two started their channel in 2005.  \"they had a lot of institutional knowledge from how things worked in a traditional space,\" hecox said of the first executives who tapped into digital. \"it wasn't really one for one when it came to digital. so there's just a lot of stuff that just wasn't very productive in the digital space. it's a very different world. it's a lot less money.\" the directive from some executives smosh worked with, padilla said, was to incorporate different elements into its youtube videos because they believed it would \"help the overall business.\" hecox said that toward the end of his and padilla's initial partnership, they gave priority to production quality in a way their audience didn't like. \"we had strayed too far away from digital and we started looking more like tv, and i think people didn't connect with that,\" hecox said. padilla and hecox now own their brand and have creative control over it. instead of stretching themselves thin to fit a traditional mold, they've redirected their focus to their roots and what fans liked the best.  the entertainment industry has gradually improved its handling of digital creators, according to jade sherman, head of digital at a3 artists agency. sherman said in the early days some agencies treated digital as \"the ugly stepchild\" of the industry. now \"people aren't trying to fit digital talent into a traditional kind of medium and then just dropping them and saying good luck,\" she said.  \"they're really trying to figure out, why should we be working with this creator in this kind of format? what makes it more impactful? what makes it different than what they're already doing? and the truth is, sometimes maybe that's not an option.\" alan chikin chow, who is represented by a3, started his career as an actor but pivoted his focus to social media content, which has led to him becoming the most viewed youtube shorts creator with a dedicated fanbase. while he still takes on traditional projects, he said youtube has allowed him to create comedy and tell stories on his own terms. \"i think the thing that is really exciting about being a creator is you have the power to create your own brand, create your own voice, and really distill what it is that you want to say, without having to kind of fit into the narrative of somebody else's project,\" he said.  traditional stars are increasingly seeing the value of digital content. superstars like dwayne \"the rock\" johnson and will smith have made successful and popular online content for years. now people like palmer and former disney channel actor christy carlson romano are building digital first media companies because of the creative freedom and reach they can achieve with that. romano said she wished she'd started making online content sooner, because it has allowed her to control her image, narrative and creative pursuits. she also said that she identifies as a content creator rather than a celebrity these days. \"it's as if you were your own network,\" romano said. \"i didn't need to wait for anybody anymore, and i would be the only person benefiting from my efforts. so it's very, very empowering.\" while creators and industry insiders are optimistic about the future of digital media, some say there's still a lot of work to be done.  \"anything that becomes the main thing has problems,\" gagliese, of viral nation, said. \"so i think you'll see a lot of growing pains ... but if you can make it through the growing pains, and you can find that kind of steady space,\" this industry, he said, \"is going to become a monster.\" \n",

search. note: on some older ios versions, siri settings might be found under general or accessibility  5 amazing siri hacks you'll want to use all the time make sure the listen for 'hey siri' is toggled on. this allows siri to be activated by voice commands  if you want siri to respond when your device is face down or covered, enable the allow siri when locked option. note: enabling this option may have privacy implications, as siri can be accessed even when your device is locked.  you can also customize siri's voice and language settings on this screen by selecting siri voice and language options.  once you have enabled siri, you can activate it by either pressing and holding the home button (on iphone models with a home button) or by saying \"hey siri\" followed by your command (if the \"listen for 'hey siri'\" option is enabled). siri should now be active and ready to assist you on your iphone. now that you have siri set up. let's dive into 10 hidden siri features that can be super helpful.  top 10 hidden siri features  1. customized pronunciation   if you use siri to call contacts, you may have experienced the voice mispronouncing a name. you can actually teach siri how to say your loved ones' names properly thanks to a type of field that can be added to the person's contact on your iphone.   first, the next time siri mispronounces a name, to fix this you can say, \"hey siri, that's not how you pronounce [name]\".  siri will then prompt you to do the following (or can proceed to do this now if you'd like)  launch the contacts app on your ‌iphone‌  select a person in your contacts  tap edit in the top right corner  under the \"notes\" section, tap add field  select pronunciation first name or pronunciation second name, depending on which name ‌siri‌ is having trouble with  next, tap the pronunciation field and spell out the name phonetically (how it sounds)  tap done in the top right corner when you're finished.  the next time ‌siri‌ says the name, it will follow your phonetic spelling.  2. remember where you parked your car   not only can you use siri to help you remember where you parked your car, the assistant can also help you find your car if needed. iphones are great at identifying when you've parked and left the location, yet if you ever want to be certain about where your car is, you can drop a pin on your maps app by using siri.  just say, \"hey siri, remember where i parked my car\" before you leave the spot. then you can retrieve the parking lot location when you want to find your parked car.  just ask siri by saying, \"hey siri, where did i park my car?\" siri will then provide you with the information it stored about your parking location, such as the address or a map with directions to your car.  3. use siri to find an airtag   if you use apple airtags, you know how helpful they are for keeping track of keys, your pets, or any other device you attach them to. you may not have realized this, but you can use siri to find your airtags if they're within bluetooth range.  just say, \"hey siri, find my airtag.\" then, depending on the location, siri may provide guidance on which direction it is in relation to where you are, or it may tell you if your airtag is nearby.  more: airtag tracker detector warns of stalkers in seconds  4. set up reminders for specific apps   siri can set reminders for apps on your device, and you can tell siri exactly when or where you want to be reminded.  for instance, if your iphone has your home location set up, you can say, \"hey siri, remind me to check my email when i get home,\" and siri will create a reminder to open the mail app when you arrive at that address. you can also say, \"hey siri, remind me to open [app name],\" and specify a time for that reminder to pop up on your iphone.  in order for this feature to work, you will need to enable location services from the reminders app. here's how:  open the settings app on your iphone  scroll down and tap on privacy &amp; security  in the privacy settings, select location services  from here, you have a couple of options:  if location services are turned off entirely, you'll need to toggle the switch on at the top to enable them. you may be prompted to enter your device passcode or use touch id/face id to make changes.  if location services are already enabled, scroll down to find the reminders app in the list and tap on it.  now, you should see three options: never, while using the app, and always. choose either while using the app or always, depending on your preference and the level of access you want to grant to the reminders app.  keep in mind that enabling location services may improve the functionality of certain features, but it also consumes more battery power. make sure to consider your preferences and privacy concerns when choosing the level of access to grant to any app.  5. keep up with sports   if you're a sports fan, you may know that siri can provide sports scores. however, did you know you can also ask siri about upcoming games, team schedules, and player information? for example, you can ask, \"hey siri, when is the next yankees game?\" or \"hey siri, what's the golden state warriors' schedule this week?\"   6. identify a song playing   if you're out in a coffee shop or in a store and you hear a song playing and want to know the title or artist, you can say, \"hey siri, what song is playing?\". siri will listen to the audio and try to identify the song using shazam integration. it will provide you with the song details and a link to listen to or purchase it. personally, i screenshot it, and then i can go back to save it on my streaming app later.   more: 5 best portable phone chargers of 2023   7. translate languages   you can ask siri to translate phrases or sentences into different languages. for example, you can say, \"hey siri, translate 'hello, how are you?' to french.\" siri will provide you with the translated version right there on your iphone. even if you have a translator app, this could be a super quick way to communicate or understand someone speaking another language as you.   for more of my tech hacks, subscribe to my free cyberguy report newsletter by heading to cyberguy.com/newsletter   8. teach siri who your contacts are  everyone has a personal preference for how they keep contact names on their phone. sometimes you may have someone saved as their first name, yet you more often call them by a nickname or by using a description when talking to siri.  help siri understand who the contact names in your phone are by saying something like, \"hey siri, joe is my son.\"  then, if you say, \"hey siri, call my son,\" your phone will know who you're referring to. you can also use this trick for your husband or wife, mom or dad, or just about any label you can think of.  how to make siri listen to you longer on iphone and ipad 9. change basic settings   sometimes it's annoying to swipe to the control center or figure out where in your settings certain things are   so use siri to do it all more quickly. for example, you can tell siri to adjust these settings:  \"hey siri, adjust the volume of my phone\"   \"hey siri, turn on (or off) airplane mode\"  \"hey siri, turn on (or off) low power mode\"  \"hey siri, turn on (or off) bluetooth\"   you can also ask siri to open settings for specific apps like chrome or your camera.  \"hey siri, open chrome\"  \"hey siri, open my camera\"  10. turn off or restart your phone   shutting down your phone or restarting it can fix a number of common glitches that happen on all technology. it's also somewhat tedious to hold down the side buttons or a combination of a side and home button, depending on your phone model. save time by having siri do it for you.  just say, \"hey siri, restart my iphone.\"  you can also shut down your phone using siri by saying, \"hey siri, shut down my phone,\" although you'll need to remember to turn it on manually using the buttons on the phone.  kurt's key takeaways  siri is handy for a number of reasons, including the voice activated convenience. for those who have reduced hand dexterity or limitations in physical movement, it's great to just be able to talk to your phone and not have to fuss around with settings or use all the different buttons our iphones come with. that makes these features particularly valuable for making iphones all around more inclusive. plus   who doesn't love a virtual personal assistant?!    do you use siri for any tricks that aren't on this list? let us know by writing us at cyberguy.com/contact   for more of my tech hacks, subscribe to my free cyberguy report newsletter by heading to cyberguy.com/newsletter      \n",

      "Title: Putin's secret weapon is Russia's facial recognition surveillance used to punish dissenters\n",
      "russian president vladimir putin is facing the biggest threat to his authority in decades. it comes after yevgeny prigozhin, who leads a private paramilitary group called wagner, started a violent but brief uprising against russia that may have long lasting effects which could bring instability to putin. if putin is perceived as weakened by this assault on his leadership, then he is likely to exert aggressive strength in a show of power. how to master apple iphone's measure app for precise measurements how putin can show his strength with weaponized tech click to get kurt's free cyberguy newsletter with security alerts, quick tips, tech reviews and easy how to's to make you smarter what few know is that vladimir putin has been building a sophisticated facial recognition surveillance system since 2017 that is likely to be put into overdrive against any citizens willing to take on the views of the russian leadership and military. more: police are using invasive facial recognition software to put every american in a perpetual lineup   russian surveillance technology is powered in part by silicon valley big tech companies in the u.s. facial recognition systems used by the russian government are widely available around the world.  russia has worked with tech companies within its own walls, and belarus building sophisticated algorithms that make it highly accurate and efficient at population surveillance.  ironically, while it seems to serve the purpose of limiting freedom, the technology works thanks to chips made by u.s. companies intel and nvidia. there is no evidence that either us company broke any export restrictions, and neither knows nor tracks how their technologies are being used.  prior to any ban, it would have been easy for the russian government to source all the needed components to build a powerful spy mechanism to track its population. for more of my security alerts, subscribe to my free cyberguy report newsletter by heading to cyberguy.com/newsletter   how russian police use facial recognition surveillance to oppress its citizens police have been known to stop and detain members of the public they suspect could challenge the authority of the kremlin.  hold up a poster that says \"freedom for russia\" and \"no to war,\" and your identity can be captured and held against you. ovd info, a human rights organization, tracks the russian government's repression of its citizens and has identified 19,700 detained russian people dating back from may 2023. don't fall for this sneaky nameless number text scam russia's spying on its people hinges on this one public necessity it starts with the metro subway system throughout russia.  passengers are required to scan their faces in order to gain access to a ride.  russia has deployed \"face pay\" in at least 240 metro stations. the government claims it is the world's largest implementation of facial recognition.  instead of a smartphone or ticket, the metro deploys facial recognition matching the russian rider with the account, location, date, and time they access a station. russian police track public protests by using facial recognition to capture the identities of protestors sweeping up as many dissenters as the surveillance system can digest. the system has been used to prevent unauthorized gatherings by blocking access to certain metro stations or sending alerts to the police. more: how to stop facial recognition cameras from monitoring your every move  when russian police sweep in to detain its citizens some hours, days, or weeks later, police located in the metro station confront russians as they arrive to scan their face to gain access to a train.  people have reported being detained anywhere from minutes to 19 hours.  while some alleged protestors detained led to arrest and being charged, many report strong arming tactics being deployed by police to dissuade further protesting or showing public opposition to the government's point of view.  it is a crime to be involved in \"public actions aimed at discrediting the use of the armed forces of the russian federation\" or to spread false information about the military, which can result in prison time from 3 to 15 years. how to keep your phone battery charged longer kurt's key takeaway if you have ever wondered why americans should be wary of similar facial recognition surveillance systems becoming a standard on u.s. soil, you need to look no further than this example of a complete loss of freedom resulting from big brother technology. the potential for abuse and erosion of individual privacy rights is a grave concern that cannot be ignored, especially when considering the potential widespread use of facial recognition surveillance systems in this country.   do you care if you are required to scan your face for access to common necessities like at your workplace, residential buildings, or even public venues?

      "Title: Urgent iOS 16.5.1 iPhone update: why you need to take action now for your security\n",
      "apple has released an urgent software update for its devices, ios 16.5.1, that you should download as soon as possible even if you have automatic updates turned on.   click to get kurt's free cyberguy newsletter with security alerts, quick tips, tech reviews and easy how to's to make you smarter  the update fixes two major security vulnerabilities. both of these are being used in real life iphone cyberattacks. if these vulnerabilities are chained together, it could allow a remote attacker potentially full control over a compromised device.   what were the security fixes that apple made?  apple's security fixes are related to the kernel and webkit components of the ios operating system. the kernel is the core of the system that manages the hardware and software interactions, while webkit is the engine that powers the safari browser on ios devices. both of these components had flaws that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges or through malicious web content.  8 great iphone accessibility tips to make life easier according to kaspersky, the cybersecurity firm that reported these issues to apple, the attackers used an invisible imessage with a malicious attachment to deliver a spyware called triangledb in a zero click attack. this spyware operates in memory and can steal various data from the infected device, such as audio recordings, photos, videos, location history, contact information, browsing history, passwords, and more.   how triangledb spyware can infect and monitor ios devices without user interaction  this means a person using an iphone, for example, doesn't even have to click anything or interact with anything on their phone for the spyware to infiltrate their device. this is especially serious with the kernel because it means that a hacker is getting to the core of the ios operating system without anyone clicking anything and can likely get around many security tools on the device.  once the spyware is on an ios device, it can take audio recordings, photos, videos, location history, and more and share them with the hacker. it can also steal contact information, browsing history, passwords, and other sensitive data.  more: the urgent iphone warning you can't afford to ignore  who has been attacked, and should i be worried?  kaspersky reported that they found several dozen iphones that were infected with the new spyware, some of which belonged to senior employees at kaspersky. the biggest targets as of now appear to be people like journalists, politicians, business executives, human rights activists, and other high profile figures. average civilians likely will not be attacked; however, you should still update your ios devices with this new software as soon as you can.  how can i protect myself against this spyware?  first, the best thing you can do right now is to get this new ios 16.5.1 update onto your ios devices asap.   how to update your ios devices  go to settings  select general  tap software update   you should see the update come up if you have not updated your device already. click install now to begin the update   more: a new malicious malware is specifically targeting iphones   have antivirus software installed  second, not all of us will remember to regularly check our devices for new updates, which is why having antivirus software installed on all your devices is always a good idea. antivirus software will make sure you are stopped from clicking on any potential malicious links which may install malware on your devices, allowing hackers to gain access to your personal information. it will also be able to scan your device for malware and other viruses and warn you if it detects something suspicious.   see my expert review of the best antivirus protection for your windows, mac, android &amp; ios devices by heading to cyberguy.com/lockupyourtech  kurt's key takeaways  you should always be checking your settings on your devices to see if software updates are available. companies like apple put these bug fixes in place to protect you and your privacy, so you should be taking advantage of what they're providing. i'm not exactly sure why apple did not release ios 16.5.1 as a rapid security response update, a new feature that allows it to push out important upgrades on the fly. maybe they wanted the flaws to be publicly known to encourage more people to apply ios 16.5.1. whatever the reason, it is up to us to remain vigilant against these hackers who constantly seek to circumvent the rules, so make sure you're paying attention, updating your devices, and keeping your information out of the hands of these crooks.  how frustrating is it to have to continue to update your iphone to ensure the security of your ios devices because of these types of vulnerabilities? let us know by writing us at cyberguy.com/contact    for more of my security alerts, subscribe to my free cyberguy report newsletter by heading to cyberguy.com/newsletter     \n",

      "one of the few republican lawmakers who addressed his family's ties to slavery was brooks. he represented an alabama district in the house of representatives for 12 years until he lost a bid for the senate last year.\n",
      "in an interview, brooks said he hadn't known that his ancestor, great great great grandfather thomas ferguson, was a slaveholder. the farmer held one person – a 7 year old boy – in bondage in haywood county, north carolina, according to the 1860 slave schedule. reuters could find no records that show what became of the child's parents. had they died? or was the family separated, sold piecemeal to other slaveholders?\n",
      "brooks wondered whether there might be a happier story behind why the boy was listed on the schedule. \"it is hard to envision what kind of labor a 7 year old boy could do to offset the food, shelter, clothing costs of that 7 year old boy. which raises the issue of whether this ancestor had the boy in his possession in a traditional slavery sense, or was intending to set that boy free once he reached the age of majority,\" brooks said.\n",
      "\n",
      "manumission was \"highly unusual,\" said historian marie jenkins schwartz, author of born in bondage: growing up enslaved in the antebellum south. \"by the age of 7, an enslaved child would be expected to be productive,\" potentially helping around the slaveholder's house, watching their children, and learning agricultural or other adult jobs, she said. \"they certainly didn't have a life of leisure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "when he was in congress, brooks was one of 14 members who voted against making juneteenth a national holiday. brooks told reuters that he preferred such a holiday be on a day he considered to be of broader national significance, such as when the emancipation proclamation was signed. in addition, brooks said he also was concerned about the cost of adding a federal holiday without eliminating a current one.\n",
      "in june 2021, brooks co sponsored a bill called the saving american history act.\n",
      "the bill directs that federal funding be withheld from schools that wish to teach materials based on the new york times' 1619 project, a series of essays about the founding of america that argued the start of african slavery that year wasn't just the country's original sin but \"as important to the american story as 1776,\" the year the united states declared independence. the scholarship of the series has been hailed by some professional historians and criticized by others. the bill didn't make it to the house floor for a vote.\n",
      "\"the federal government,\" the bill reads, \"has a strong interest in promoting an accurate account of the nation's history through public schools and forming young people into knowledgeable and patriotic citizens.\"\n",
      "\"it's always good to know history,\" brooks told reuters.\n",
      "asked about his view on reparations, brooks said the country has already paid one form of restitution, through a civil war era program proposed by union general william tecumseh sherman.\n",
      "\"you may remember – what was it – 40 acres and a mule?\" brooks asked. \"now i'd have to check my history on how prevalent that was. but some freed slaves were given some amount of reparations, if my memory serves me correctly, and that is the origin of the phrase '40 acres and a mule.'\"\n",

      "had the order been followed, it would have provided black americans assets upon which to build new lives and perhaps pass wealth to subsequent generations.\n",
      "but the program ended quickly, gates wrote. president andrew johnson, the southern sympathizer who succeeded abraham lincoln, \"overturned the order in the fall of 1865\" and returned the land \"to the very people who had declared war on the united states of america.\"\n",

      "for service companies that experience a summer slowdown every year, finding ways to keep staff members productive during this time is crucial for maintaining momentum and utilizing resources effectively. while customer or client work may decrease, there are many valuable activities that employees can engage in to make the most of their and the company's time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "here, 18 forbes coaches council members highlight strategies companies can use to ensure teams remain productive during the summertime. from professional development and skills training to brainstorming sessions to make process improvements and enhance internal operations, check out the various avenues service companies can take to help team members focus their efforts in the most beneficial ways when business is slow below.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. focus on free professional development\n",
      "during a summer slowdown, service companies can keep staff productive by focusing on free professional development, process improvement, research, team building, creative projects, networking and free employee well being initiatives. these activities maximize employee engagement and contribute to long term growth.   foluso gbadamosi, folusogbadamosi.com\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. evaluate what can be improved\n",
      "i love saying, \"go slow to go fast,\" and summer slowdowns are a great time to invest in personal leadership development. leadership starts with the person. slow seasons are also great for evaluating which systems, tools or processes need to be revamped. lastly, the gift of \"free\" vacation time for employees (whether it is a day or more) from the company goes a long way to rejuvenate staff members for busy times.   melissa deluca, deluca & willow\n",
      "\n",
      "3. reflect on what has gone well and not so well\n",
      "during a summer slowdown, i would focus on three specific things: take time to reflect on what has gone well, what hasn't gone so well and what we can take forward. there is energy that can be taken from reminding ourselves of our success, and learning is invaluable for growth. second, sharpen the saw and focus on personal development. finally, i would look at high impact, short burst projects to set us up for success.   ricky muddimer, thinking focus\n",
      "more fromforbes advisorbest travel insurance companiesbyamy daniseeditorbest covid 19 travel insurance plansbyamy daniseeditor\n",
      "4. maximize employees' talent\n",
      "ask employees what they want to contribute in specific areas of the business that will further a certain strategic goal, and then agree on the parameters. this will keep them engaged and excited to be contributing to a valuable, possibly new function for when the business will be back in the swing of things!   cellene hoogenkamp, kokuahub inc\n",
      "\n",
      "5. prepare to cope with future challenges\n",
      "a popular saying advises that \"you have to redo your roof when the weather is nice!\" a business slowdown is a very good time to step back from the daily routines and do a strategic review of activities. here are some questions to answer: \"are we prepared for the next challenges? are we investing enough in people, technologies and innovation to cope with future challenges, both ecological and social?\"   catherine tanneau, activision coaching institute\n",

      "forbes coaches council is an invitation only community for leading business and career coaches. do i qualify?\n",
      "6. get strategic and build new, faster systems\n",
      "when business is slow, get strategic! any slowdown is a perfect time to invest in building new systems to handle scale and speed. when you have space in the calendar is the time to build templates, processes and business continuity systems, as well as purge inventory and document libraries. slow times are when you lay the foundation to make the faster times smooth!   david taylor klaus, mcc, cpcc, ctpc, dtk coaching, llc\n",
      "7. brainstorm future services\n",
      "during slowdowns, companies get an incredible opportunity to work on building their team, planning forward, brainstorming future services, reviewing their current processes, testing services for validation and training on new skills that the team may need. this opportunity allows for great growth inside a company if used wisely.   bobbie goheen, synthesis management group\n",
      "8. tie up loose ends, then rest and recharge\n",
      "there is an ebb and flow in life and in business. the key here is to understand that everything is cyclical and change is always around the corner. i encourage my clients to take advantage of the slower times and work on the business by tying up loose ends, getting organized in house, strategizing on business development and doing some fun team building activities. rest and recharge for the busy season—it's coming!   cheryl keates, pcc, cheryl keates\n",
      "9. conduct team building activities\n",
      "a slow period is the perfect time to evaluate the efficiency of the business. looking at department policies, processes and service offerings to determine if any changes are necessary will allow the company to help more customers during the busy season. this is also a great time for team building through volunteer days, cleaning the space, and training and development.   lindsay miller, reverie organizational development specialists\n",
      "10. focus on meeting training goals\n",
      "focusing on meeting training goals for personal and professional development can effectively fill the time during a summer slowdown for service based companies. this reminds employees they have the power to move the needle in their career trajectories and builds their growth mindset.   ariel mcgrew, tactful disruption ® \n",
      "11. cross train employees\n",
      "one of the strategies that companies can use to keep their staff members productive during the summertime is to cross train employees. by teaching staff members new skills or having them work in different areas of the business, you can help them stay motivated and prevent boredom or burnout. it is also a great way to keep them engaged and productive when facing a summer slowdown.   paula vidal castelli, paula vidal castelli intl., llc\n",
      "12. hire a development trainer or facilitator\n",
      "a summer slowdown is the best period to use spare time for learning and development so that staff members can sharpen their skills and knowledge or learn new skills to be ready for the peak season. hiring a trainer or facilitator can be a great way to ensure learning and development will not only benefit personal growth, but also business growth.   senem anataca, 180utc\n",
      "13. work on improving internal operations\n",
      "one of my favorite quotes is, \"you do not rise to the level of your goals. you fall to the level of your systems,\" by james clear. if there is downtime, businesses should always be working on improving internal operations, such as processes, it systems and so forth. this will not only likely save the business money, but it also will increase the engagement of your team.   wendy fong, chief gigs\n",
      "14. conduct market and user research\n",
      "here are three ways companies can take advantage of slow times during the summer: 1. hire a training company to train staff on new systems, such as ai technologies. 2. carry out business process improvement initiatives by mapping out, analyzing and improving existing processes. 3. conduct market and user research—review all customer databases as well as competitors' data, and create an improvement action plan for the busy periods.   eno eka, the business analysis school\n",
      "15. innovate and collaborate\n",
      "a summer slowdown allows for space to create. task your staff with working on projects that set their hearts on fire and are of high service to your clients. test out a new offering. connect with your best customers. if you can do this as a team, even better!   amy pocsik, bold moves\n",
      "16. reflect on where you are and start a passion project\n",
      "a common frustration i hear from successful people is that they struggle to make time for strategic thinking. a natural slow point is perfect for reflecting on your direction of travel and on the balance you're striking. how do you really feel about the life you are creating? where do you want to course correct? then use passion projects as a vehicle for indulging and expanding your capabilities.   duncan skelton, duncan skelton coaching ltd\n",
      "17. create new products and better services\n",
      "use the benefit of downtime to create new products and better services and to provide opportunities for your team to develop new skills. when the clients are ready, your team will also be ready to provide new and better services for your clients!   cindy lamir, impact business coaches\n",
      "18. encourage and allow employees to take more pto\n",
      "companies should be encouraging teams to take paid time off with family and friends during the summer months. research shows that offering sabbaticals is the best way to get people to return to the office refreshed, more grateful and more productive than they were before they left. so, organizations should allow more time off in the summer so that employees come back refreshed and do their best work.   carmelina piedra, careercoachingpro\n",

      "method acting, also known as \"the method,\" based on the early 1900s teachings of russian director konstantin stanislavski and popularized in the united states by director lee strasberg, is a technique in which actors \"use their physical, mental and emotional self in the creation of a character\" to achieve an authentic performance, according to the lee strasberg institute.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "in conversation with jennifer lopez for the variety studio: actors on actors series, robert pattinson said: \"you only ever see people do the method when they're playing assholes. you never see someone being lovely to everyone while they're really deep in character.\" lopez agreed, stating after years of making movies she often can't wait to go home and let go of her characters. sebastian stan said method acting \"reads like an irresponsible, narcissistic thing. it reads like, 'i'm afraid, and i want to torture everyone else because of it.'\" some have also criticized modern conceptions of method acting for straying from stanislavski's teachings. jon bernthal said he doesn't see the benefit of method acting, but criticized how far the technique has strayed from stanislavski's teachings: \"making everybody call you by your character name and not showering for eight months was not what stanislavski had in mind with the method,\" he told the hollywood reporter last year. will poulter criticized actors using method acting \"as an excuse for inappropriate behavior,\" stating an actor's process shouldn't infringe on other people's work environment. jeremy strong, star of the hbo hit succession, made headlines for comments from co workers about his intense process on the set (which he does not consider method), which kieran culkin said \"doesn't help me\" and brian cox called \"f——  annoying,\" adding he worries about what it does to him mentally.\n",
      "contra\n",
      "andrew garfield defended method acting last year, stating it is \"not about being an asshole to everyone on set. it's actually just about living truthfully under imagined circumstances.\" he criticized misconceptions of method acting and stated the technique helped him on the 2016 film silence. some stars, including strong and tony kushner, defended method actor daniel day lewis, who famously goes to great lengths for his roles, both of who worked with him on lincoln. after a new yorker article detailing strong's immersive acting process went viral, jessica chastain and anne hathaway defended his process. \"when we talk about process, when we talk about intensity, when we talk about method, when we talk about all this stuff, it's all good to me. nothing ever strikes me as weird,\" hathaway said.\n",
      "key background\n",
      "majors, who maintains he is innocent, was arrested in march on charges of strangulation, assault and harassment of a 30 year old woman, who referred to majors as her partner in text messages shared with tmz by majors' attorney priya chaudry. multiple alleged abuse victims of majors have since come forward and cooperated with legal authorities, and majors was subsequently dropped by talent agency entertainment 360 and pr firm the lede co. he also lost several film roles, including the upcoming film adaptation of the walter mosley novel the man in my basement, in which he was supposed to star and serve as executive producer, as well as an otis redding biopic. majors appeared in court in june for a hearing in which his trial date was set for august 3. a rolling stone investigation published thursday, based on interviews with more than 40 sources granted anonymity, alleges that majors physically abused one romantic partner, emotionally abused two romantic partners and treated crew members on film sets poorly. majors' attorney denied the allegations raised in the rolling stone article. \"everyone who has worked with mr. majors knows that he employs an immersive method acting style, and while that can be misconstrued as rudeness at times, those who know mr. majors and work in the industry have attested to his dedication to his craft as well as his kindness,\" his lawyer dustin pusch told indiewire.\n",

      "Title: How The Robotics Business Model Is Shifting To Meet Manufacturers Where They’re At\n",
      "share to facebookshare to twittershare to linkedinwhen i was a kid, the idea of a real life robot felt foreign. earth was for humans. the jetsons and their robot maid, rosie, existed only on television.\n",
      "\n",
      "now i work in manufacturing and frequently find myself advising companies that, you know that job you can't find the right person to fill? that process you haven't perfected? for that role, perhaps you should consider something a bit more metal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the pushback, and there is plenty, tends to sound a lot alike. it's too expensive. or, it takes too long to set up. or, we just don't have the tech skills to handle that sort of thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "but what if i told you that you don't need any special skills. that there are folks who will do the setup—and even the maintenance—for you. that it may not be as pricey as you think, particularly when you weigh a robot's productivity against a human being— or beings — in the same role.\n",
      "\n",
      "for manufacturers, the fear of robots is real. manufacturers fear their investments won't amount to anything, that they'll be bogged down by maintenance and end up even worse off.\n",
      "but i say fear not, because these days there are business models that cater to smalland medium sized manufacturers who don't have the in house staff to manage robots on their own.\n",
      "\n",
      "make technology more affordable with robotics as a service\n",
      "one such model is used by rapid robotics, a san francisco based company that provides robotics as a service. ceo and co founder jordan kretchmer saw the high costs falling on manufacturers installing robots. industrial robots could cost anywhere from $40,000 to $500,000, the company says. even with rent a robot programs popping up to lower the hardware burden, manufacturers were stuck with implementation costs often soaring into the six figures.\n",
      "as an alternative, rapid provides both ends of that equation — the physical robot and the implementation, plus ongoing maintenance and reprogramming — at a flat, monthly fee. their low risk model shields customers from high startup costs and ensures they'll be able to adjust and recalibrate the robot as needs evolve. that happens often when it comes to things like injection mold operations, cnc loading, palletizing, packing and labeling boxes, and other tasks that are otherwise ripe for automation. \"those tasks tend to change over a lot,\" kretchmer says. \"meaning if you automate it with a very specific kind of machine and a very specifically programmed robot, the chances that the operation is going to remain the same for the next two or three years is really, really slim these days.\"\n",
      "more fromforbes advisorbest travel insurance companiesbyamy daniseeditorbest covid 19 travel insurance plansbyamy daniseeditor\n",
      "rapid's service is not necessarily cheap. for a basic robotics arm work cell, it costs $35,000 per year — paid monthly — plus a one time onboarding fee of an additional $35,000. but kretchmer says those numbers stack up favorably versus the cost of talent, providing companies with positive roi faster than they'd experience with a large initial investment. depending on how many shifts you're running it, the cost of the cobot — or collaborative robot — breaks down to about $6.50 or $7 an hour after year one. the company also offers larger cobots which, at the high end, are priced at $50,000 for a yearly subscription plus $50,000 in one time onboarding costs. but those machines can replace tasks that usually take two or three people to complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "kretchmer ultimately believes raas can help companies begin to reshore parts of their operation to build resiliency. \"those little bits and bobs that were so easy to outsource, but that are critical components to really important products,\" he says. \"those need to be made locally.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "get expert help to customize and find the right solution\n",
      "rapid robotics has created a promising model. but it's not the only way to institute a high quality cobot into your manufacturing firm.\n",
      "just ask the school lunch maker innovative food services. founded in 2022, the company grew from a modest restaurant catering business serving 200 or 300 meals a day to a school lunch focused business that pumps out 9,000 meals daily. ifs has had to scale their operations quickly.\n",
      "along the way, one job on the assembly line was constantly creating problems for ceo thomas lane's staff. it was a position at the end of the line in which an employee would take the meal trays and stack them inside large plastic totes, with a lot of twisting and turning and bending along the way. the role was a back killer, and even rotating various employees in an out of it during each day was causing inordinate amounts of strain. so, one day, ifs reached out to magnet, the nonprofit manufacturing consultancy i run out of cleveland.\n",
      "we worked with a robotics provider to build and deploy a custom cobot that took the place of that difficult, end of line job. \"switching over to the cobot, they're able to line up six meals, pick up all six, move them over and drop them down into totes,\" lane says. \"not only has it increased the speed and the efficiency of our line, but also our worker satisfaction. it was a win all the way around.\"\n",
      "ifs would end up purchasing two cobots, one for each of their assembly lines. within 60 days of building, plus a couple more to train staff for regular maintenance, the company was up and running. all in all, lane says the cobots were less expensive than expected, paying for themselves within about 18 months.\n",
      "\"i just encourage other manufacturers to really take that leap if they're on the fence about it,\" lane says.\n",
      "the future of robotics\n",
      "it's difficult to say what's coming next for robotics. business models like the one rapid robotics deploys are attractive in their simplified, all in one approach. but it remains to be seen whether manufacturers are willing to trade out one time investments — however large they may be — for the subscription model.\n",
      "regardless, there's a lot to be encouraged about when it comes to robotics deployment, from the largest manufacturers to some of the smallest. robotics companies are beginning to realize that the average manufacturer needs help implementing their technology, and they're getting creative and finding implementation partners to provide that expertise. the reward will be sizable: investments in robots contributed 10 percent of the gdp growth in oecd countries from 1993 to 2016, according to one study. and robotics capabilities have only continued to improve.\n",
      "we may be yet to build the world envisioned on the jetsons, but robots have arrived and are here to stay — and that's a good thing for manufacturers.\n",

      "with his what matters most tour traveling through the us until october, folds spoke with forbes about his (possibly) final record, teaching music, and leaving rock'n'roll to the kiddies. these are edited excerpts of the conversation.\n",

      "that's an honorable assignment. not that \"the grinch\" wasn't. but, you know. that was... whatever it was. actually i wrote a song for the grinch movie not knowing what the movie was because they were so secretive about it. all i knew was that it was a comedy and i guess jim carrey was in it?\n",
      "\n",
      "but you didn't ask me about that one.\n",
      "being a parent, watching people being formed and the ideas that go into their heads early, i felt a responsibility. when i was a kid, \"horton hears a who\" was huge for me. it made you think about the things that were tiny and the things that were big. the imagination when you're a kid is much better than the reason. i tried to inject the song with a healthy dose of both.\n",
      "i just felt like i was in really good hands. i really like the writers and the producers of the show and what they're doing. it's an honor to be anywhere part of the whole peanuts legacy. maybe in years to come it counts.\n",

      "i love your last record but, going back to it after this one, a certain thorniness comes through. even the title, \"so there\" — there's a bitterness there. i don't want to read too much biographical information into it but were you in a more content place making the new record?\n",
      "i suppose probably so. though i really think of songwriting and making records way more in a lab coat than most people. thorniness is often a way, with humor, to connect, humanize, make sure that the narrator isn't perfect.\n",
      "of course it's also personal too. i'm not trying to run from it. but i use it because at the end of the day it feels like technique.\n",

      "\n",
      "but you know, i do also feel, i'm not nearly as thorny as i was. i mean, i was pretty ready to fight and be sarcastic when i was younger. even my piano playing, i can see in retrospect, anyone who thought that it was angry — they were right. that's where i got my fuel: i was pissed. [laughs] i can't even tell you why.\n",
      "there's a really impressive joke density to \"exhausting lover.\"\n",
      "that's really interesting and really nice that you would notice that. it's a little down in the gutter, so it's easy for a punter to go, oh that's ridiculous, oh that's silly.\n",
      "timing in comedy is super important. when you're also restrained by syllable stress and rhyme and 3.5 minute real estate and introduction and chorus form... it gets harder.\n",

      "my wife would hear that song come back out again. \"jesus christ that fucking song...\"\n",
      "we were in an apartment for 18 months in australia while all the biggest parts of the covid drama were going on. so i didn't have access to a real piano for nearly two years. i had the mic that i bought right before lockdown. and my laptop. that freed me up to do things that were ridiculous... like that. i did some other things that were ridiculous but that climbed its way to the top of the ridiculous pile.\n",
      "and then there was inner debate about whether to put that on the record or not. the record was turning conceptual in a way — and sober and earnest. so why do this to myself? why have one star taken off my record on everyone's review just to be silly like that?\n",
      "and probably someone will find something offensive too because it's not clean comedy. i looked at it — is there anything that's going to hurt anybody? i couldn't find a victim, i couldn't find lack of consent.\n",
      "\n",
      "advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "at the end of the day, i thought, it's really refreshing for me to hear this in sequence. it's very me to quasi sabotage my record with something like that. so i thought, yeah i'll pay a star — fuck you. so there's a little bit of anger on the record. [laugh]\n",
      "you spent some of the pandejo teaching music online. what did you learn from that?\n",
      "that's scary because when you start teaching like that, it wakes the intellect up while you're writing, which i don't like to do. it's kinda like, you're hearing inner voices you shouldn't be hearing. everything i ever learned in music had the effect of making me worse for a period of time before it sinks in. i would get very self conscious after doing these lessons. 'well let's see what the fucking professor's got to say.'\n",
      "most of us songwriters would prefer not to do that.\n",
      "you wrote about the idea of retirement when you were 17, in \"boxing.\" \"back to anonymous\" feels like a more deeply felt return to that theme.\n",
      "\n",
      "advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "anything that feels like it's breaking the rules a little bit feels rock'n'roll to me. writing about fading into obscurity would seem to be the worst thing you could do as a quote unquote rockstar. \"too old to rock'n'roll, too young to die\" was a joke — he was making fun of someone else. then he found himself on stage singing it shaking his ass in leather pants 55, 60 years old too.\n",
      "for this, i was like, what if i was just to relax? writing true vulnerability and weakness into a song ... that's attractive to me. i do feel more anonymous now.\n",
      "but my other hangup is it's so first world. we have hit a point of almost \"victim chic.\" so, with that being so in style, for someone to say, 'hey guess what, people don't recognize me anymore!' [laughs] that does seem super insensitive to anyone's plight that's actually real.\n",
      "i've always loved that really late era song of leonard cohen, \"going home.\" his real self is talking to his tiny ego. that stuff is really powerful to me. and i think when you get older it becomes allowable.\n",

      "i can't imagine a convergence of those things again or the motivation to do it. i think rock records are, as i've said in my little book, for the mating age. it's the music to figuring out who you are, where you're going, who your fucking parents were that you're not. and yearning.\n",
      "the wedding, the pregnancy, the job... it's life and it's wonderful, but it's not rock'n'roll. we don't need that music anymore. time to let the kiddies come up and do it.\n",
      "i always tell people i'm not interested in taking my shirt off and walking around burning man at 55 years old, tripping balls. i'm not interested in that. i don't want to be a kid.\n",

      "strong brand governance is all about managing how you show up in the world and ensuring it's done in a way that reflects consistency in how customers engage with your brand. this goes for everything—from each logo and asset your brand has to the way your company's brand voice is activated across channels and markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "why is this important? well, it impacts the bottom line. consistent branding helps build awareness and recognition, which is important for success. according to a 2021 statista study, 35% of participants acknowledged that consistency played a part in contributing to at least 20% of their company's revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "take a company like nike, for example. from its iconic \"swoosh\" to its powerful \"just do it\" messaging, nike's branding is instantly recognizable and has inspired long term loyalty among its fans. that wasn't achieved overnight but was a painstaking process of investing in its brand and showing up consistently across every customer touch point over many decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "historically, managing this process would be very top down and hierarchical. the traditional model would have one brand manager act as the sole guardian of a company's brand identity, overseeing every customer facing campaign, product and communication that went through its rigorous approval process before reaching the public.\n",
      "more fromforbes advisorbest travel insurance companiesbyamy daniseeditorbest covid 19 travel insurance plansbyamy daniseeditor\n",
      "though this \"iron fist\" approach offers a comforting sense of control, in reality, it's an illusion. in a world where assets are being created for dozens of channels and markets all around the world, this type of approval model is not easily scalable and cannot move as fast as brand managers need it to. that's why we're increasingly seeing brands adopt a \"lean\" approach—a fresh take on brand governance that boosts collaboration and enthusiasm and makes ownership of brand governance everybody's business.\n",
      "\n",
      "accountability breeds responsibility, but how do you get your people to buy in?\n",
      "when your team members care about your brand and feel pride in it, they are much more likely to go the extra mile and care about using the right assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "at the heart of any successful branding strategy are the people who champion it, which is why it's essential to have brand champions in each department who truly understand your brand's essence and values. these ambassadors must possess a deep understanding of your brand's story and be able to seamlessly articulate its nuances to their colleagues. they are equipped with the knowledge and tools to help their peers find and utilize different brand assets in their daily work.\n",
      "so how do you help people play that pivotal role in your organization? the first thing to prioritize is removing friction. we all know how frustrating it is when you can't find the latest version of an asset, and this is where mistakes can creep in. one way to simplify things is to implement a digital asset management system that centralizes a company's brand assets so that everyone—wherever they sit in the business—knows how to use the right logos, images, videos and collateral in their work. this reduces the need for time consuming email exchanges, increases efficiency and helps swerve the likelihood of publication errors. and while technology isn't the one stop shop answer to all brand compliance challenges, companies can use a range of tools to help manage their brand—from guideline and design tools to entire platforms dedicated to asset management and collaborative working.\n",
      "investing in training whenever you introduce these types of systems is key. providing additional resources such as tutorials from the design department, creative templates for frequently used brand assets, and comprehensive brand guidelines, for both global and local markets, can be invaluable. when everyone has a shared understanding of the brand's importance, employees can see beyond bright colors and flashy logos and feel a deeper investment in their work. this can help them become more engaged and invested in their roles, ultimately fostering a sense of ownership that encourages them to take greater responsibility for the brand's success.\n",
      "breaking free from brand policing: empowering brand guardians for long term success\n",
      "brand policing is a trend of the past. today's consumers demand transparency and consistency across all platforms, and brands that empower their employees to become brand guardians are the ones that will succeed in the long run.\n",
      "this is underscored by recent findings from a survey by sprout social, which found that \"86% of americans believe transparency from businesses is more important than ever before.\"\n",
      "as digital channels increasingly become the primary means of connecting with customers, taking a top down approach to brand governance is no longer feasible to holistically maintain a brand's health.\n",
      "this shift toward collective ownership allows for a more organic approach to brand management, enabling individuals to take ownership of their contributions and make informed decisions that align with the brand's values and mission. the brands that successfully trust their people to take this step will be the ones that turn one brand manager into an army of brand guardians.\n",
      "by providing a central hub for teams to collaborate on brand guidelines, assets and projects, everyone in the organization is enabled to have access to the information and tools they need to become brand guardians. and in turn, these brand guardians will be committed to the long term protection and enhancement of your brand.\n",

      "Title: Gay male couples face more challenges, higher costs to start a family\n",
      "watch nowvideo3:2603:26gay men face more challenges and higher costs to start familysquawk boxbret shuford and stephen hanna knew from early on in their relationship they wanted to raise a child together. but the married couple didn't think a biological child was a possibility.as freelancers in the creative arts, shuford and hanna don't always see steady income, even when working on broadway. the houston based couple, known as the \"broadway husbands,\" thought having a child with a donor egg and gestational carrier \"seemed like it was something that was only available to people who were very wealthy,\" said shuford, 44.it's a safe assumption that having a child with a surrogate, now most often called a gestational carrier, is cost prohibitive. while expenses vary widely due to a number of medical and legal factors, \"the average cost of surrogacy in america has gone from $75,000 five years ago, to anywhere between $150,000 and $250,000 today,\" according to dr. brian levine, a reproductive endocrinologist who founded surrogacy matching platform nodal.more from personal finance:how lgbtq+ seniors can tackle their special caregiving challengesfinancial advisor: here are 4 important money tips for parents with young kidsteenagers are in high demand as summer hiring surge gets under wayin the u.s., there are only about 5,000 successful surrogacy journeys per year, nodal estimates.\"that's only about 8% of met need,\" levine said. \"in plain english, 92% of the people that dream of starting or growing or completing a family with surrogacy will not be able to do so in america due to the sheer time and cost constraints that are there today.\"why gay male couples face higher costsalon rivel, left, with his family.courtesy alon rivelalon rivel always wanted to be a father. \"as i grew up, i realized i was gay,\" said rivel, 34. \"so i thought, this will never happen for me. i don't have the money, but i wanted it desperately.\"\"we were shocked when we started to look into [having a biological child] and realized nothing is covered by insurance unless you can prove that you're infertile,\" said rivel, who lives in arlington, massachusetts. he and his husband believed that \"this is complete discrimination on the insurance company's part because we are gay men.\"\"it is not a choice,\" rivel added. \"we were born this way and, thus, we are actually infertile.\"experts say the demand for surrogacy relationships has grown since same sex marriage became legal in the u.s. in 2015.gay male couples typically face a more expensive journey, as surrogacy or adoption are their primary choices. in contrast, same sex female couples are often able to carry pregnancies to term on their own, though they may possibly have to pay for donor sperm and fertilization.sadly, we do see in some states that there are laws that discriminate against the lgbtq+ community.betsy campbellchief engagement officer for resolve: the national infertility associationdonor eggs are exponentially more expensive than donor sperm largely because the egg retrieval process is more invasive and complicated. while costs, again, vary wildly, donor eggs and the associated costs can range between $20,000 and $60,000, according to fertility marketplace gostork, while donor sperm can be from as little as several hundred dollars to around $1,000.donor eggs, meanwhile, are only one of many expenses.shuford and hanna's health insurance covered only the tests done on their sperm samples. their remaining expenses, they estimate, ran between $150,000 and $180,000. that included around $40,000 for donor eggs, the medical costs to create, store, test and freeze embryos, medical insurance and out of pocket medical costs for their gestational carrier, her compensation, and other expenses.the couple used savings, credit cards and high interest loans to cover that tab. rivel and his husband's journey to parenthood ultimately cost $220,000.\"we're taking money away from our child's college fund,\" he said. \"we're taking money away from our mortgage.\"\"compared to [many of] our friends, our baseline is $200,000 below where they started,\" rivel added.employer fertility benefits offer limited helpmore employers are starting to offer fertility benefits, often through a specialized fertility benefits manager such as kindbody, carrot, progyny or maven. in 2022, 40% of u.s. employers offered some type of fertility coverage, up from 30% in 2020, according to the international foundation of employee benefit plans.fertility iq, which keeps a workplace index of employer fertility benefits, found the average amount of fertility coverage in 2021 was $36,000 per lifetime, flat from the year before.but while more companies are offering fertility benefits, many of these packages are limited when it comes to covering what's needed to build families using non traditional methods. almost two thirds, 63%, of lgbtq+ people plan to use assisted reproductive technology, foster care or adoption to become parents, according to a survey by family equality.yet fewer than half of employers offering fertility benefits provided any benefits for adoption, and only about 10% provided benefits related to surrogacy, according to a 2021 survey from resolve: the national infertility association and health care consultancy mercer. and state laws requiring employers of a certain size to offer fertility benefits often leave out coverage for third party reproduction such as a gestational carrier or the purchase of donor eggs or donor sperm.\"i honestly believe that employers don't realize there is a gap in their benefits. and they often don't know this until an employee points that out,\" said betsy campbell, chief engagement officer for resolve.she said many employers she speaks to have \"the best intentions\" but don't understand how gestational surrogacy works or how family building benefits fall short.will porteous, 39, became a father through gestational surrogacy before joining maven as its chief growth officer. he and his husband tabulated their parenthood path cost at close to $175,000. \"no employer in the entire country that i'm aware of offers anything greater than $75,000 a year, and so that only covers a portion.\" will porteous, right, with his husband, doug, and their son, walter.courtesy will porteousbut porteous, who lives in wynnewood, pennsylvania, said full coverage isn't necessarily what lgbtq+ couples want to see. \"the expectation is to have equitable support to your other co workers and seeing that your employer cares about that journey,\" he said.that employer support, porteous said, \"really means a lot and it shows that you as an employer care about your employee, regardless of how they're going to build their family.\"fertility benefits can help recruit, retain talentwhile fertility benefits manager progyny's first clients were largely west coast \"silicon valley type\" businesses, according to ceo pete anevski, it now works with employers in 40 industries.\"there's a flywheel effect happening,\" he said, with more companies realizing benefits need to include family building coverage \"to be competitive, to attract and retain talent in what is still a tight labor market, an inflationary economy, even with concerns around a looming recession.\" fertility benefits manager carrot said it has around 800 corporate clients and 80% of those offer their employees a benefit for surrogacy. \"we have seen an increase in surrogacy claims year over year at about 250%,\" said ceo tammy sun. offering these types of benefits can be key factors for a company when job candidates are making decisions about employment, said taryn branca, chief revenue officer at kindbody.\"i can't tell you how many of our clients will call us, we will get on the phone with potential candidates that they're recruiting, or we will provide information to support that recruit coming there because they are asking for very specific information before they'll accept the offer: if they have surrogacy benefits, if they have donor benefits,\" she said.more than half of respondents in a new progyny survey of lgbtq+ community members said they are actively looking to build their families. of that population, 79% would consider leaving their current job for one that offers better fertility and family building benefits, and 80% would consider taking a second job to receive those benefits.\"this is not a 'nice to have,' this is a 'need to have' benefit,\" anevski said.rivel's husband is an early employee at massachusetts based beam therapeutics. at rivel's insistence, he asked his human resources department to look into including surrogacy benefits. eventually, the company added a surrogacy reimbursement benefit, which at the time rivel and his husband used it was worth $10,000. while $10,000 was a small dent in the couple's $220,000 surrogacy journey, rivel said it's better than nothing. \"it's really admirable that they have it,\" he said. \"i think it's a really smart benefit for recruiting more people.\"adoption also comes with high costs, risksadoption is certainly another family building option. \"it's not for everyone ... it's not without its costs, and the laws vary by state,\" resolve's campbell said. \"sadly, we do see in some states that there are laws that discriminate against the lgbtq+ community, so that's definitely a consideration.\"the average nonfoster system adoption costs between $25,000 and $60,000, according to the child welfare information gateway. as with surrogacy relationships, the adopting parents cover related expenses for all parties, from medical to legal, plus living expenses if a match is made in advance of a birth. and, of course, there are no guarantees.shuford and hanna decided adoption wasn't a path for them. \"there's a lot of risks involved that we weren't willing to take,\" hanna said. \"we had heard of stories involving birth mothers changing their minds, and children having birth defects that without [genetic embryo testing] weren't known.\"'it was totally worth it'stephen hanna, left, with his husband, bret shuford, and their son, maverick.courtesy bret shuford and stephen hannalike many gestational carrier stories, shuford and hanna's was far from easy or straightforward.their first carrier dropped out of the process shortly before the embryo transfer was scheduled to take place but well after contracts had been signed and medical assessments and travel had occurred. the covid 19 pandemic delayed the process with their second gestational carrier; then, after the first embryo transfer, the pregnancy ended in a devastating miscarriage. the second embryo transfer worked, and their surrogate gave birth to their son, maverick, in 2022.\"so many times, we felt very excluded,\" shuford said. \"we want to be able to have a family and raise our child and have that child be biologically related to us, and we have a right to do that, and we have a right to feel seen and validated in that process.\"but for shuford, \"in the end, it was totally worth it.\"\"i mean, maverick is amazing,\" he added. \"and we're so lucky to have a healthy baby and also having someone like crystal, our surrogate who carried our child.\"\"i don't know that i've ever experienced that kind of love in my life,\" shuford said. \"so it's really a powerful experience.\" \n",

      "oddity il makiagecoutesy: odditybeauty and tech company oddity, which runs the il makiage and spoiled child brands, filed to go public friday as the once frozen ipo market warms up. the israel based company plans to trade on the nasdaq using the ticker odd. the company didn't immediately disclose how the offering would be priced in regulatory filings and declined comment when asked when the numbers would be released.\"the number of shares to be offered and the price range for the proposed offering have not yet been determined. the offering is subject to market conditions, and there can be no assurance as to whether or when the offering may be completed, or as to the actual size or terms of the offering,\" oddity said in a press release.launched in 2018 by brother and sister duo oran holtzman and shiran holtzman erel, oddity uses data and ai to develop brands and make tailored product recommendations for customers.the business is seeking to disrupt a market long dominated by legacy retailers by replacing the in store experience with product recommendations driven by ai and data. at the heart of its business model is its proprietary technology — including tech developed by a former israeli defense official — and the billions of data points it has collected from its millions of users.in the three months that ended march 31, the company saw $165.65 million in revenue, up from $90.41 million in the year ago period. it reported a net income of $19.59 million, or $5.34 a share, compared with $3.01 million, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier.numbers revealed in its regulatory filing show the direct to consumer retailer has been profitable on an annual basis since at least 2020.in fiscal 2022, oddity brought in $324.52 million in sales and saw a net income of $21.73 million, or $5.94 a share. in the year prior, the retailer saw $222.56 million in revenue and a net income of $13.92 million, or $4.01 a share.in 2020, it saw $110.64 million in sales and a net income of $11.71 million, or $3.45 a share.by comparison, when e.l.f. beauty filed to go public in august 2016, its profits and sales were lower than oddity's. e.l.f., a multibrand beauty company, saw $144.94 million in sales in fiscal 2014 and a net loss of $2.88 million. the following year, it saw $191.41 million in sales and a net income of $4.36 million. in fiscal 2016, it brought in $229.57 million in sales and a net income of $5.31 million. since going public, e.l.f.'s sales and profits have climbed. during its most recent fiscal year, which ended march 31, it saw $578.84 million in sales and a net income of $61.53 million. as a direct to consumer retailer, oddity is seeing the high margins that come along with the strategy. in the three months that ended march 31, its gross margins were 71%, up 4 percentage points from 67% in the year ago period. its annual margins have slipped each year since 2020 as the company has made acquisitions and invested in growing the business.in 2020, oddity had an annual gross margin of 70%, and in 2021, it dropped 1 percentage point to 69%. in 2022, the retailer's annual gross margin was 67%, down 2 percentage points from the year ago period.as of march 31, the company had more than 4 million active customers, which it defines as a unique customer account that made at least one purchase in the preceding 12 month period.\"we bring visitors to our website, turn visitors into users by asking questions and learning about them, and then leverage the data we have across the platform to convert them into paying customers,\" a regulatory filing says.oddity has launched internationally, and sales from those markets accounted for about 26% and 27% of its net revenue in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. as of friday, oddity has launched in the u.s., canada, u.k., continental europe and australia. it noted it has plans to keep growing that footprint.the company plans to use proceeds from the ipo to develop and launch new brands. it will also use the funds for working capital, other general corporate purposes and potentially for acquisitions and other investments.during an interview earlier this year, the company's global chief financial officer, lindsay drucker mann, a former goldman sachs executive, told cnbc that oddity is making money and growing — even against a tough macroeconomic environment that has proven increasingly risky for purely digital retailers. on average, oddity's gross sales have doubled each year since 2018, the company has said.in spoiled child's first year on the market, the new brand brought in $48 million in gross sales, which does not include returns. in a regulatory filing, holtzman, the company's ceo and co founder, said the company recruits from the israeli defense forces' best technology units. technologists comprise over 40% of its global head count.\"as industry outsiders, we saw many shortcomings in the status quo approach. the empires that incumbents had built over decades had not evolved with the times, resulting in a significant lag in online adoption,\" holtzman wrote in a founder's letter enclosed in a securities filing.\"their underinvestment in technology left the category behind the digital curve, despite a consumer who is inherently primed to buy online — spending significant time on social media for beauty content and rapidly shifting dollars online in other categories.\"(l to r): dr. david zhang, oddity's new head of bioengineering and the chief science officer and co founder of revela; oddity co founder shiran holtzman erel; oddity co founder and ceo oran holtzman; dr. evan zhou, oddity's new chief science officer and revela's co founder and ceo.alberto vasari for odditybeyond developing new products and brands, oddity is also trying to make beauty products more effective, the company has said. in late april, it announced it was investing more than $100 million to acquire biotech startup revela and open a u.s. based lab.the merger brought to oddity a team of scientists tasked with creating brand new molecules, using artificial intelligence, that can be used in its cosmetics brands and future lines.in 2021, oddity acquired voyage81, a deep tech ai based computational imaging startup founded in 2019 by niv price, the former head of research and development for one of the israeli defense forces' elite technological units, along with dr. boaz arad, dr. rafi gidron and omer shwartz.the technology is capable of mapping and analyzing skin and hair features, detecting facial blood flows, and creating melanin and hemoglobin maps using a regular smartphone camera.the filing comes after a year and a half of a drought in the initial public offering market, which is just beginning to open up and show signs of green shoots. earlier this month, mediterranean restaurant chain cava went public, and its shares soared as much as 117% in its market debut. \"[in 2022] investors didn't want to go anywhere near ipos but now that they're making money again, and with issuers seeing that they can achieve close to decent valuations, i think that's bringing the people back into the market,\" said matt kennedy, a senior ipo market strategist for renaissance capital.\"the consumer sector does lend itself to these periods where investors can see a business model that they understand, a business that they might be familiar with and also one that is typically profitable or near profitable, preferably that has growth.\" \n",

      "file photo: the port bow railing of the titanic lies in 12,600 feet of water about 400 miles east of nova scotia as photographed as part of a joint scientific and recovery expedition sponsored by the discovery channel and rms titantic.stringer | file photorescuers in a remote area of the atlantic ocean raced against time tuesday to find a missing submersible before the oxygen supply runs out for five people who were on a mission to document the wreckage of the titanic.despite an international rescue effort, u.s. coast guard officials said the search covering 10,000 square miles (26,000 square kilometers) had turned up no signs of the lost sub known as the titan, but they planned to continue looking.authorities reported the carbon fiber vessel overdue sunday night, setting off the search in waters about 435 miles (700 kilometers) south of st. john's, newfoundland. aboard were a pilot, renowned british adventurer hamish harding, two members of an iconic pakistani business family and a titanic expert.the submersible had a 96 hour oxygen supply when it put to sea at roughly 6 a.m. sunday, according to david concannon, an adviser to oceangate expeditions, which oversaw the mission.that means the oxygen supply could run out thursday morning.cbs news journalist david pogue, who traveled to titanic aboard the titan last year, said the vehicle uses two communication systems: text messages that go back and forth to a surface ship and safety pings that are emitted every 15 minutes to indicate that the sub is still working.both of those systems stopped about an hour and 45 minutes after the titan submerged.\"there are only two things that could mean. either they lost all power or the ship developed a hull breach and it imploded instantly. both of those are devastatingly hopeless,\" pogue told cbc on tuesday.the submersible had seven backup systems to return to the surface, including sandbags and lead pipes that drop off and an inflatable balloon. one system is designed to work even if everyone aboard is unconscious, pogue said.experts said the rescuers face steep challenges.us coast gurad captain jamie frederick speaks during a press conference about the search efforts for the submersible that went missing near the wreck of the titanic, at coast guard base in boston, massachusetts, on june 20, 2023.joseph prezioso | afp | getty imagesalistair greig, a professor of marine engineering at university college london, said submersibles typically have a drop weight, which is \"a mass they can release in the case of an emergency to bring them up to the surface using buoyancy.\"\"if there was a power failure and/or communication failure, this might have happened, and the submersible would then be bobbing about on the surface waiting to be found,\" greig said.another scenario is a leak in the pressure hull, in which case the prognosis is not good, he said.\"if it has gone down to the seabed and can't get back up under its own power, options are very limited,\" greig said. \"while the submersible might still be intact, if it is beyond the continental shelf, there are very few vessels that can get that deep, and certainly not divers.\"even if they could go that deep, he doubts rescuers could attach to the submersible.by tuesday morning, an area totaling 10,000 square miles had been searched, the u.s. coast guard tweeted.the canadian research icebreaker polar prince, which was supporting the titan, was to continue conducting surface searches with help from a canadian boeing p 8 poseidon reconnaissance aircraft, the coast guard said on twitter. two u.s. lockheed c 130 hercules aircraft also conducted overflights.the canadian military dropped sonar buoys to listen for any possible sounds from the titan.concannon, who said he was supposed to be on the dive but could not go, said officials were also working to get a remotely operated vehicle that can dive to a depth of 3.7 miles (6 kilometers) to the site as soon as possible.oceangate's expeditions to the titanic wreck site include archaeologists and marine biologists. the company also brings people who pay to come along, known as \"mission specialists.\" they take turns operating sonar equipment and performing other tasks in the submersible.the coast guard said monday that the titan carried a pilot and four \"mission specialists.\" however, oceangate's website suggests that the fifth person may be a so called \"content expert\" who guides the paying customers.authorities have yet to formally identify those on board, though some names have been confirmed, including oceangate ceo stockton rush, who, according to the company, was serving as a member of the crew.rush told the associated press in june 2021 that the titan's technology was \"very cutting edge\" and was developed with the help of nasa and aerospace manufacturers.\"this is the only submersible – crewed submersible – that's made of carbon fiber and titanium,\" rush said, calling it the \"largest carbon fiber structure that we know of,\" with 5 inch thick carbon fiber and 3.25 inch thick titanium.a us coast guard vessel sits in port in boston harbor across from the us coast guard station boston in boston, massachusetts, on june 19, 2023.joseph prezioso | afp | getty imagesharding, who lives in dubai in the united arab emirates, was one of the mission specialists, according to action aviation, a company where harding serves as chairman.harding is a billionaire adventurer who holds three guinness world records, including the longest duration at full ocean depth by a crewed vessel. in march 2021, he and ocean explorer victor vescovo descended to the lowest depth of the mariana trench. in june 2022, he went into space on blue origin's new shepard rocket.also on board were pakistani nationals shahzada dawood and his son suleman, according to a family statement. the dawoods belong to one of pakistan's most prominent families. their eponymous firm invests across the country in agriculture, industries and the health sector.shahzada dawood also is on the board of trustees for the california based seti institute that searches for extraterrestrial intelligence.french explorer and titanic expert paul henry nargeolet was also aboard, according to david gallo, a senior adviser for strategic initiatives and special projects at rms titanic. gallo identified nargeolet, a friend who has led multiple expeditions to the titanic, on tuesday during an interview with cnn.greg stone, a longtime ocean scientist based in california and a friend of rush, called the lost submersible \"a fundamentally new submarine design\" that showed great promise for future research. unlike its predecessors, the titan was not spherical in shape.\"stockton was a risk taker. he was smart ... he had a vision. he wanted to push things forward,\" stone said.the expedition was oceangate's third annual voyage to chronicle the deterioration of titanic, which struck an iceberg and sank in 1912, killing all but about 700 of the roughly 2,200 passengers and crew. since the wreckage's discovery in 1985, it has been slowly succumbing to metal eating bacteria.oceangate's website described the \"mission support fee\" for the 2023 expedition as $250,000 a person.recalling his own trip aboard the titan, pogue said the vessel got turned around looking for the titanic.\"there's no gps underwater, so the surface ship is supposed to guide the sub to the shipwreck by sending text messages,\" pogue said in a segment aired on \"cbs sunday morning.\" \"but on this dive, communications somehow broke down. the sub never found the wreck.\" \n",

      "a passageway near the bank of england (boe) in the city of london, u.k., on thursday, march 18, 2021.hollie adams | bloomberg | getty imageslondon — the bank of england on thursday surprised markets with a 50 basis point hike to interest rates, its 13th consecutive increase as policymakers grapple with persistently high inflation.the monetary policy committee voted 7 2 in favor of the half percentage point increase, which takes the bank's base rate to 5%. the move defied market expectations, which had priced in around a 60% chance of a 25 basis point hike.sterling slipped against the dollar after the announcement while yields on u.k. government bonds — known as gilts — also retreated slightly. the yield on the 10 year gilt was down by around 4 basis points. yields move inversely to prices.fresh data on wednesday showed annual u.k. consumer price inflation was 8.7% in may, unchanged from the previous month, cementing market expectations that the mpc would opt for another hike. economists also upped their expectations for further monetary tightening in the future.watch nowvideo3:3103:31bank of england surprises as it hikes rates to 5%squawk box europemost worryingly for the central bank, core inflation — which excludes volatile energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices — was 7.1% year on year in may, up from 6.8% in april and marking its highest rate since march 1992.\"there has been significant upside news in recent data that indicates more persistence in the inflation process, against the background of a tight labour market and continued resilience in demand,\" the mpc said in its summary thursday.\"the mpc will continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures in the economy as a whole, including the tightness of labour market conditions and the behaviour of wage growth and services price inflation. if there were to be evidence of more persistent pressures, then further tightening in monetary policy would be required.\"policymakers are walking a tightrope as they attempt to tighten monetary policy sufficiently to quell inflationary pressures without triggering a full scale mortgage crisis and recession.the mpc said that the high number of fixed rate mortgages means that the full impact of the increase in the bank rate so far \"will not be felt for some time.\"since the end of 2021, the bank has hiked its main rate from 0.1% to 5%.\"the economy is doing better than expected, but inflation is still too high and we've got to deal with it,\" bank of england governor andrew bailey said in a statement thursday.\"we know this is hard — many people with mortgages or loans will be understandably worried about what this means for them. but if we don't raise rates now, it could be worse later.\"a 'hawkish super hike'although the market had partially priced in the larger increase, several analysts suggested that the size of the majority voting in favor of it implied a sense of urgency among mpc members.joseph little, global chief strategist at hsbc asset management, said the \"hawkish super hike\" comes at a critical juncture for the economy and signals policymakers' desire to \"get ahead of the curve.\"\"the u.k. finds itself in the worst position of major western economies. a cost of living crisis, brought about by rising energy and food prices, has been amplified by structural labour shortages, and has now metastasised into ratcheting wages,\" little said. \"inflation pressures show more persistency and more momentum than other western economies, and that forces the bank into a hawkish corner. today's statement has increased concerns of a much higher terminal policy rate, perhaps as high as 6%.\"although all developed economies endured a similar post covid pandemic deluge of inflationary pressures, u.k. headline inflation is decelerating at a much slower rate, while the core component is significantly higher than all other g10 nations and still accelerating.huw davies, investment manager at jupiter asset management, said thursday's move from the mpc was \"a tacit admission that they have been behind the curve in their hiking policy,\" and the rate rise represents \"an attempt to regain the initiative and their credibility.\"\"the key problem is that u.k. real rates have consistently been negative despite the tightening cycle. it feels like the boe will have to inflict more pain on u.k. households to achieve a return to a controlled level of inflation more in line with their inflation target,\" davies said. \n",

      "my relationship with wellness is more complicated than running into a guy i ghosted at an office party. i began my journey in 2017 as a lot of people do: dressed in lululemon and sipping green juice on my way to a yoga class. (i had chosen trap classes because i was much more comfortable hearing \"mouth full of golds\" during child's pose than risking stepping on a white woman's yoga mat.) soon, wellness became a capitalistic pursuit i held near. i loved grabbing a blue spirulina smoothie while out on a run — but only dressed in head to toe nike gear. lulu was for the gym and yoga. i became obsessed with rings, namely, closing the ones on my apple watch. \n",
      "by 2020, after spending thousands of dollars on this journey without seeing any measurable improvement in my mental health — which people do experience from wellness efforts — i began to interrogate why i expected this effort to cure my anxiety and depression. i was sidelined by the coronavirus pandemic and, like many others, began to question what actually mattered to me. still, i did yoga, strength trained, cycled, and meditated at home to keep myself mentally afloat during the pandemic and during the antiracism protests over the murder of george floyd, an immensely triggering moment for black folks. having a routine was helpful until it wasn't. \n",
      "by 2022, i was experiencing weekly panic attacks that slowly increased to i don't know how many days a week. i wasn't sleeping or moving much farther than from my bed to the couch. when i was eating, i wasn't choosing nutritious foods. i'd run out of motivation to care for myself — and all of it felt like it shouldn't be happening to me because i should be tougher.  \n",
      "mainstream wellness was, to lean further into cliches, a band aid on a bullet wound. i was actively pursuing better mental and physical health, a key piece of a wellness journey, but i wasn't taking the time to establish what felt good to me. i was trying to fit into the trendiness of wellness, and i desperately wanted the freedom it proclaimed i could have if i bought enough stuff. nowadays, i define wellness as, \"doing what feels good and aligns with what i believe i need in this moment.\"\n",
      "my burnout story is a quintessential narrative among black women. many of us have been raised to be \"strong\" despite the systemic factors that make such an ideal impossible to uphold. the strong black woman trope demands that we swallow our pain for the greater good of others, and it comes with grave psychological consequences. it can make us more susceptible to depression, anxiety, and feelings of isolation. for some black women, we rarely forgive ourselves for our mistakes and relentlessly seek to meet others' expectations. this is more harrowing when we consider that stress compounds. besides causing headaches, chest pain, fatigue, and stomach issues, heightened stress levels can make sleeping impossible. your breathing can quicken. you could develop high blood pressure, a weakened immune system, anxiety, depression, type 2 diabetes, or memory loss — adverse health outcomes that black people are more likely to experience. \n",
      "the systemic conditions that prevent black women from being able to take proper care of ourselves is one of our nation's most significant health injustices. and to add insult to our spiritual injury, wellness practices, which can be a useful tool to fight poor mental health, are presented to us through a eurocentric, capitalist lens, encouraging us to spend money many of us don't have on products we don't need to care for ourselves. \n",
      "i discussed these conditions and the role wellness plays in navigating them with deja love, the ceo of the black women's wellness agency. love's agency supports black women who are stressed, burnt out, and overwhelmed by connecting them to black women wellness providers. this could be a yoga teacher, meditation or life coach, personal trainer, or any non clinical wellness service that helps manage stress. \n",
      "\"we have to go deeper because the world in which we're living in, it's not sustainable for us to keep at this pace,\" love says. \"i really view this as a fierce urgency, as life or death. when black birthing persons are dying at three times the rates of white folks, that's a crisis. we are dying, across the board, at higher rates. this is why it's so important.\" \n",
      "this interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. \n",
      "explain your personal approach to wellness. is it more spiritual? or is it more political? \n",
      "for black women, our wellness is infinite. that it is not a $200 yoga mat or yoga pants. since, especially in the mainstream context of the united states — which is incredibly racist with white supremacist undertones — wellness is generally capitalistic. it's about the doing, and the purchasing. \n",
      "infinite wellness is knowing that maybe wellness for me in one moment is sitting in silence, sensory deprivation, not on social, not logged in, but sitting, connecting to breath, connecting to the divine spirit that guides us, whatever folks identify with. in the context of america, wellness is rest. it's challenging a toxic grind culture that tells us we need to constantly produce, that we're not enough, that we're not doing enough. i'm guided by tricia hersey and her work. she leads the nap ministry, and her book rest is resistance has really shifted my paradigm and informs a lot of what i view as wellness.\n",
      "what are some of those white supremacist undertones to wellness? \n",
      "it's really this notion of, \"i have to do something. i have to purchase something. i have to buy something. i have to keep performing.\" and that can look like, \"i need to buy the expensive mask. i need to buy expensive face serums. i need to go to the gym classes.\" it's still a perpetuation of grind culture and hyper productivity. whereas the black woman's wellness agency and i challenge that and say, \"black women, you are enough by just being!\" it seems so simple, but the brilliance is in the simplicity of being — not doing. wellness is shifting our minds away from what we have been indoctrinated with, such as: \"i have to be a certain weight, i have to look a certain way, i have to have this.\" no. we have to be on the path of unlearning.\n",
      "those are some of the undertones. it's about this aesthetic, and that's what we get. but wellness is not an aesthetic. wellness is being connected to our breath, our bodies, and calming the mental fluctuations that happen constantly. \n",
      "this multibillion dollar wellness industry that says you have to drink this or take this supplement or be in this intricate yoga posture just creates more work. \n",
      "why isn't wellness binary for black women? i was looking on your website, and i saw that. i think i know what that means, but i'm very, very intrigued.\n",
      "it's not binary because we, as black women, are so robust. we have had to be. we've had to be the heads of households, to be cooks and cleaners, to raise children and make sure the finances are handled — we're constantly wearing so many hats. our healing and our wellness are not going to be boxed in. it can't be, because we have to do so much. \n",
      "black women are the largest demographic of advanced degree holders and business owners post 2020. we're doing so much, and that's why we're proponents of wellness being whatever it is you need. \n",
      "if wellness is saying, \"i'm just really tired, and i don't need to push through,\" then that's wellness. if wellness is saying, \"my family is expecting me to do something, and i say i can't do that because i need to uphold my boundaries, and i can't keep pouring from this empty cup,\" then that's wellness. that's the journey that i'm still on. we're all still on it. \n",
      "it has to be full spectrum and incredibly inclusive. it has to counter the mainstream approach to wellness — the skinny white woman in lululemon doing an intricate yoga posture. that is not true wellness; that is a capitalistic approach that we have been fed, and we have to keep pushing back because that image may not serve us. now, we are not a monolith, so maybe that image serves some black women. i know for many, though, that it does not.\n",
      "one thing that i think most black women can all relate to is the pressure to fit into these spaces, whether it's work or a yoga studio, where you're the only black person there, and people are looking at you crazy. so when we reclaim and reframe wellness — meaning we stop looking at it through this billion dollar lens — how do we reconnect with our power? \n",
      "it's multifaceted. it will take many different approaches. one of them is going for a walk and doing a walking meditation, not having your airpods in, just listening to the sounds of nature so you can get out of your head and connect with the many thoughts that are going to come into your mind. i don't want to demonize social media. it's an amazing tool that connects us, but part of reclaiming is having healthy sabbaticals from social [media]. \n",
      "i'm also a proponent of therapy. therapy helps us be introspective. \n",
      "another thing that has helped me is being able to be free. business ownership has allowed me to feel free. i've had an 18 year career in many business sectors, and within all of those sectors, you become indoctrinated, and your truth gets stifled by the dominant group. and even those who look like me can fall into assimilation and respectability. i speak unapologetically, and many people do not connect, and that's fine. i've had to make peace with the fact that i may not get all the business contracts, or i may not gross the revenue that i want. but i can sleep at night knowing that i am speaking for black women, that i am challenging inequities, the status quo, and a society that perpetuates it.\n",
      "you pointed out that when black women really start taking care of ourselves, prioritizing our needs, and start centering our well being, we lose people. it's always been very interesting to me that when a black woman starts thinking about her well being versus how she can be in service to everyone else, people start dropping off. \n",
      "earlier today, when i was on my walk, i was thinking about when we're on journeys of evolution. i don't want to be the same deja i was three years ago, a year ago. i want to be evolving, and learning, and there are folks that will not be there on that journey ... it's hard sometimes. it's always the folks you don't expect, the people who were always there. and that just hurts harder. part of that evolution is releasing that attachment. and the folks that connect to me will find me. i will build a new community. \n",
      "it's like my granny used to say, \"everybody can't come.\" speaking of her — a black woman who absolutely prioritized her well being after raising three generations of her family — how does wellness help black women thrive?\n",
      "it helps us because we are able to get reconnected with self. when i'm putting on my public health hat, our life expectancy is reduced in this white supremacist, very racist society. from medical racism in health care, housing, education, transportation — every facet that we intersect with has a huge impact on our outcome. every facet of being in this country challenges us. wellness helps us get back to our center when all of these forces that create the inequities we live in challenge us.\n",
      "sometimes we will question ourselves. we forget the confidence, the power, the self esteem, the self efficacy because we have been metaphorically beaten down by all of these systems.\n",
      "we even have to combat the complicity of folks in our own communities and other white adjacent folks of color. i know that's a provocative notion. black people and other folks of color can uphold white supremacy because we're all stewed in the same society. so people get surprised, for instance, that a black physician can perpetuate harm to their black patients. they have been trained in racist medical schools, so they can perpetuate what they have been taught. that's why wellness is so important. wellness is whatever a black woman needs. we know what we need for our healing, to feel grounded, to feel at peace, to feel centered. that is crucial as we navigate this society that we operate in.\n",
      "how does taking care of ourselves challenge hustle culture? sometimes this strikes me as a conundrum. we're trying to get out of this capitalistic dynamic of wellness, but we live in a capitalistic society, and we have to survive. and sometimes, for certain wellness practices, you have to buy something. it feels very sticky sometimes to see taking care of yourself as a challenge to capitalism when we live in a society where it's so deeply entrenched.\n",
      "it's so important because grind culture is insidious. we are not even aware of the hold that grind culture has on us. that's why stepping back transforms. \n",
      "again, i'm not immune from it. that's why i'm so intentional with my unlearning, even as a business owner, challenging myself to not just push through. i'll say: \"deja, you've been up for how many hours? you've been in how many back to back meetings? go out, take a walk, do a guided meditation, go do some yoga, just do something!\" \n",
      "i want to see a world where all black women, and i use that term inclusively, are well. where we're not burnt out, where we're not overwhelmed, where we're not stressed, where employers don't undervalue our contribution — they're not even paying us the full dollar! we're getting what? sixty seven cents on the dollar? and working twice as hard to prove ourselves. that is the encapsulation of grind culture and being unwell. \n",

      "\n",
      "      most news outlets make their money through advertising or subscriptions. but when it comes to what we're trying to do at vox, there are a couple of big issues with relying on ads and subscriptions to keep the lights on.\n",
      "\n",
      "first, advertising dollars go up and down with the economy. we often only know a few months out what our advertising revenue will be, which makes it hard to plan ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "second, we're not in the subscriptions business. vox is here to help everyone understand the complex issues shaping the world — not just the people who can afford to pay for a subscription. we believe that's an important part of building a more equal society. and we can't do that if we have a paywall. \n",
      "\n",
      "it's important that we have several ways we make money, just like it's important for you to have a diversified retirement portfolio to weather the ups and downs of the stock market. that's why, even though advertising is still our biggest source of revenue, we also seek grants and reader support. (and no matter how our work is funded, we have strict guidelines on editorial independence.)\n",

      "out of the millions of fungal species in the world, only a few hundred can make people sick. coccidioides is one of them — and it lives in desert dust. microscopic spores are kicked up when the ground is disturbed; if inhaled, they can cause an infection known as valley fever. most people recover without ever knowing they had it, but others will experience far more intense symptoms, ranging from pneumonia to meningitis. coccidioides is also really good at eating ... meat. \n",
      "fortunately, this fungus is typically only found in the southwestern us, parts of mexico, and central and south america — and cases are rare. but unfortunately, that range is expanding quickly. scientists are racing to understand exactly why, because even though this fungus has existed for millennia, there are still tons of unanswered questions about how it lives both in the desert and in people.\n",

      "for a show incredibly concerned with the reality of restaurant kitchens — the heat, the stress, the yelling, the emotions — the bear is ultimately a fantasy, and that's all the more clear in season two. \n",
      "the first season, which found fiercely talented young chef carmen \"carmy\" berzatto (jeremy allen white) in his hometown of chicago running his recently deceased brother michael's (jon bernthal) sandwich shop, was sweaty, dirty, shouty, and as helen rosner wrote for the new yorker, something of a fairy tale. thanks to the gorgeously frenetic directing style that matches the show's substance, we followed along as carmy navigated everything from balancing a severely mismanaged budget to teaching a fine dining mentality to his skeptical crew (including his \"cousin\" richie (ebon moss bachrach)). after those trials, however, the season ended with a deus ex machina: before his suicide, michael had hidden hundreds of thousands of dollars in tomato cans, saving the shop and allowing his skilled younger brother to open the high end restaurant of his dreams. \n",
      "in its second season, the bear — also the name of the coming restaurant — is ready to tackle that challenge, and the show has unfurled into something bigger, better, more satisfying than its intricate collaboration of style and substance. if the first season poses the question of what an ambitious, dedicated, and inspired team can do with enough money, the second season has a touching answer: nurture their talent.\n",
      "early on, sydney (ayo edebiri), carmy's second in command, is in a rut. opening the restaurant that they want to open is all she's ever dreamed of. but the freedom comes with the duress of delivering a menu that's as good as they want it to be. for both chefs, but especially sydney, that means food that will earn a michelin star. she blows carmy's palate with food that's too salty; he throws it up into a paper towel. she tries again. he spits it out again. closer but not there. they need a reset, he declares. then he tells her to just go eat. she follows orders, making her way through chicago's best restaurants — starting with a breakfast sandwich at kasama (tagalog for togetherness) and visiting the city's lauded eateries like avec, margie's candies, pizza lobo, and publican quality meats) — before gathering her wits and attempting a ravioli dish.\n",

      "she ends up hating what she made, but not before exemplifying the show's sly second season credo: a compassionate daydream where nothing is more important than nourishing the staff's gifts. from marcus's (lionel boyce) trip to copenhagen to richie's entry into the world of staging to the joy in tina (liza colon zayas)'s smile when syd makes her her sous chef, the bear never wavers from its conviction that talent and inspiration are precious. while there might be stress about exactly how much to spend on plates or how to pass the fire safety test, there's never a question about if it's worth it to make these people better at what they love to do. \n",
      "approaching the idea of (troubled) genius isn't foreign territory to the bear. the show has tackled it before, mainly in the context of how skill and aptitude go hand in hand with upward trajectory. carmy is so gifted that he finds freedom from his messy family life to work at one of the best restaurants in the country. his brilliance gives him escape, however briefly. carmy's talent is too big for the sandwich shop he inherits, and season one is about whether or not he can learn how to harness it into this mode of success.\n",
      "but this season, the show proves that talent is not strictly an individual endeavor. to grow as a person takes a community; a team effort. from sydney to marcus to tina to the famed chef terry (olivia colman in a glorious cameo), the throughline is that all these remarkable people need or needed people in their lives to nurture their gifts.\n",
      "that's evident in the episode \"honeydew,\" when carmy and sydney want marcus to up his pastry chef game. despite the increasing financial strain the restaurant is facing, they decide, without question, to send him on a trip to hone his desserts. the destination is copenhagen, where he'll sleep on the same houseboat and feed the invisible cat that carmy once did, and train under icy and talented pastry chef luca (will poulter), one of carmy's cohort. \n",
      "luca is firm but shows marcus how to create wildly punctilious desserts, like a scoop of ice cream so temperamental it needs to be caressed a certain way and a shiso gelee that ultimately ends up in a \"minty snickers bar.\" marcus's knack for picking up technique impresses luca enough that he tells marcus a story about a chef (who may or may not be carmy) so good that he forced luca into a bittersweet revelation. on the one hand, luca realized he'd never be the best, and on the other, this unnamed chef somehow unburdened him from the pressure he was putting on himself, allowing him to be the best he could be. luca found community in competition and realized that talent isn't a zero sum game where someone else's talent negates your own.\n",
      "there's room for everyone; talent inspires and fosters success, and marcus is part of that circle.\n",
      "similarly, the team sends tina to culinary school. again, cost doesn't even come into question. she thrives, relishing the opportunity to improve her skills. in the second season, initially guarded tina's hunger for self improvement is one of her defining characteristics, as is her fierce loyalty to carmy and syd. it makes the small moment in episode five, when carmy lets her bring his knife to culinary school, feel momentous. with carmy's confidence and tools, tina filets her culinary fish confidently, a determined look in her eye as the blade flips through the flesh. the cut is so good her instructor congratulates her. \n",

      "the best episode this season has richie staging a week at the best restaurant in the world in \"forks.\" richie begins by polishing forks. he hates every second of it, convinced this is all some exquisite and unusual punishment. it isn't until someone points out to richie that being able to change someone's day is truly wonderful, that it finally begins to click that he's watching extreme talent sharpened with extreme discipline.\n",
      "when he sees how the restaurant's servers communicate like soldiers speaking in secret code, detailing diners' stories, lives, eating habits, and allergies, he lights up. watching jess (sarah ramos) expedite, like a conductor telling their horn section to blow, thrills him. the once reluctant fork shiner is able to identify the restaurant's plethora of sauces in a blind taste test.\n",
      "he's high on success, on feeling like he's part of this team. richie wants to be the best version of himself. richie wants to work at this restaurant. but that's not how it all works.\n",
      "at the end of richie's week, he runs into chef terry (colman) cleaning mushrooms, a seemingly menial task. after peeling a couple of mushrooms himself, he takes a moment to apologize, thanking her for doing carmy a favor. she says that it actually wasn't a favor or a punishment, but that carmy told terry that he believes in richie and that he's naturally good at front of house. he doesn't let her see it, but it warms his heart. she also tells him that it's never too late to start over, that she crashed and burned and needed a reset too. \n",
      "a sign in her kitchen reads: \"every second counts.\"\n",
      "it's an homage from her to her late father, and a message that richie will never forget. terry's story also ties back, again, to the idea of how greatness needs a family or a community to survive. without her father, without her staff, without the people who helped her, she wouldn't be the most successful chef in the game.\n",
      "this idea that people who recognize talent should foster it and help it grow goes both ways. sydney, marcus, tina, richie, and even chef terry are lucky they've found someone who believes in them. if you want to grow as a person and hone your craft and what you love, you need to find someone who believes in you. it isn't a coincidence that carmy's biological family is portrayed as an acidic, toxic hindrance to his career, and that the one he's created for his team — via his network of chefs — is the literal opposite.\n",
      "of course, this is all a fantasy. \n",
      "bosses don't usually send their employees to scandinavia to nourish their souls and ignite their inspiration. a fantasy where our jobs make us better and recognize our brilliance and diligence is even more appealing as we're living in a reality suffering from burnout and the threat of ai replacement. the restaurant world — as the bear is keen to show us — is a different universe.  and even then, the bear is more of an exceptional exception and not the norm. \n",
      "there's no guarantee that these characters will make good on their talent or that their talent will somehow lead to the success of carmy's restaurant. that's ultimately up to the fickleness of a cruel industry. but i can't help but hope that it does. \n",

      "that haze you can see and smell on a particularly polluted day is made of ozone and fine particulate matter. \n",
      "fine particulate matter, known as pm2.5 (the 2.5 microns describes its size, 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair) can embed in the cells of the lung and the bloodstream, aggravating inflammation, asthma, heart disease, and mental health. and ozone causes similar damage. in the stratosphere, ozone blocks ultraviolet radiation from the sun, but at ground level it can cause shortness of breath and damage to respiratory tissue. \n",
      "both pollutants can affect the entire body in all stages of life: young and old, and even the developing fetus. they come from sources as varied as the tailpipe of a truck, your neighbor's barbecue, coal plant, or an incinerator. pm2.5 is capable of traveling thousands of miles across the world on the wind — taking, for instance, about five days to reach the us from china. \n",

      "what is the air quality index?\n",
      "the air quality index, set by the environmental protection agency, is your guide to how bad the air quality is outdoors. the data that goes into the air quality index comes from 5,000 air monitors across the country, including local, state, tribal, and federal reporting. \n",
      "there are actually two aqis for air quality, one for particulate matter and one for ozone, but when you see just one aqi, you're looking at whatever pollutant is the higher of the two. \n",
      "you can find the latest aqi on the epa's airnow website or by downloading its airnow app. weather apps are often using propriety data from a company called breezometer to determine aqi and forecasts. these numbers are based on epa monitoring but may not be identical to the epa's aqi, though they should be in the same ballpark. outside the us, air pollution monitoring can vary widely depending on the country, so aqis reported around the world may also be pulling from a mix of computer modeling and satellite data.\n",
      "there are some important drawbacks to the aqi. it tries to distill a lot of information into one datapoint, and it depends on air monitors often placed near cities and not close to industrial polluters. since air pollution can vary widely even over short distances — think a busy highway versus a quiet, tree lined road — the air could be worse if you're near a pollution source. communities of color are systematically exposed to more pollution from industrial sources and transportation, and the aqi doesn't do a good job capturing that disparity. \n",

      "who really needs to pay attention to the aqi?\n",
      "ideally, everyone should monitor the aqi. epa experts liken it to understanding the weather. \n",
      "people have different sensitivities to air pollutants, just as people can have different temperatures they're comfortable at. they can even be more uncomfortable with one type of pollutant than another.\n",
      "but the epa breaks out its recommendations for a general population group and a sensitive population. the sensitive group is actually quite large. if you have asthma or copd, you fall in this category, but so do young children (under age 5), older adults (over 65), and pregnant people. \n",
      "\"the younger the child is, the faster their breathing, and so pound for pound, they are breathing more air pollution,\" said lisa patel, a stanford professor of pediatrics and an executive director of the medical society consortium on climate and health. \"we use 5 as a cut off for particular vulnerabilities because age 0 5 is a period of really rapid lung growth. and so exposure to those toxins so early is particularly concerning, but it's also concerning across the entire spectrum of ages.\"\n",

      "what are the six level of air quality? and when should i be concerned?\n",
      "the epa breaks the air quality index into a few categories with different recommendations. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "green (0–50): the air is safe to breathe.\n",
      "\n",
      "yellow (51–100): the air quality is considered moderate, except for the most sensitive groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "orange (101–150): sensitive groups should reduce heavy exertion outside or take more breaks, and people with asthma and heart disease should watch for symptoms. the rest of the population may be fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "red (151–200): the air is unhealthy for everyone. sensitive groups should avoid being active outdoors, while everyone else should reduce their time outdoors.\n",
      "\n",
      "purple (201–300): the air is very unhealthy for everyone. everyone should consider moving their activities inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "maroon (301 and above): this is the highest level — hazardous — and anyone can be at risk. everyone should avoid physical activity outdoors, and if you're sensitive, you should remain indoors.\n",
      "\n",
      "doctors and public health experts urge people to monitor any symptoms as pollution levels climb, especially once the aqi is in the orange and red range. \n",
      "the symptoms to watch can vary. a surefire sign to take it easy (limiting activity outdoors and potentially seeking medical help) is shortness of breath. coughing, discomfort, and tightness of the chest can all signal issues with breathing. \n",
      "other symptoms could be less obvious, throat irritation, fatigue, a stuffy nose or a headache. an epa expert explained she feels a side stitch when exercising on a bad air day. \n",
      "in infants, patel suggests to look out for grunting noises, bobbing heads, and using chest muscles to breathe as warning signs. kids who have asthma should have an asthma action plan set with a health provider on using an inhaler.\n",
      "it's important to pay attention to these symptoms in both adults and children while regularly checking the aqi level at which you start to feel discomfort. starting this now will help you in the future when you need to decide what precautions to take and when.\n",
      "what are the precautions i should take outdoors, and when should i take action? \n",
      "the aqi is most confusing when it falls into the yellow, orange, and red ranges. \n",
      "if you are sensitive to air pollution, then you want to reduce your exercise and heavy exertion outside once the aqi hits orange. the entire population should start taking precautions when it is in the red territory. you might even want to reconsider spending extensive time outside at these higher levels, and don an n95 or kn95 mask if you do need to be outside (cloth masks will not protect you from pm2.5).\n",
      "it helps to think about reduction in terms of dosage. you can cut your time outside, your exertion level, or both. if you reduce a 30 minute walk to 15 minutes, you're cutting your exposure to the pollution by half. if you sit on your porch instead of going for a walk or run, you're also cutting down how much pollution you inhale.\n",
      "when is air pollution at its worse?\n",
      "the time of year, and even the time of day, can matter immensely for air quality. \n",
      "ozone is typically at its worst in warmer months, between april and october in the us. it needs sunlight to trigger its chemical reactions, so late afternoons and early evenings can be smoggier than the mornings. emissions that come from the tailpipes of cars and burning fossil fuels interact to form ozone that can build up to dangerous concentrations depending on geography and weather patterns. \n",
      "particulate matter's worst months are usually peak wildfire season, so late summer and fall. again, though, there are no strict rules here. wildfires are no longer contained to predictable seasons due largely to climate change, as the east coast experienced when canadian wildfires caused smoggy extremes in early june. other sources of pm2.5 include barbecues and fireworks, making july fourth and the days that follow worse for air quality. \n",
      "tracey holloway, an atmospheric scientist at the university of wisconsin madison who works with nasa, also explained that, unlike ozone, pm2.5 \"comes in different flavors.\" she explained, \"there are some situations where pm2.5 is highest at night because it's trapped [an inversion where the ground is cooler], and there's some situations where pm2.5 is highest in the middle of the day because it's cooked up by the sun.\"\n",
      "though experts focus mostly on the two main pollutants of concern in air pollution, pm2.5 and ozone, there are other substances that can hitch a ride with this pollution. patel, the pediatrician, said wildfire smoke is especially toxic. burning trees can release more mercury in the air because of how the pollutant has settled on surfaces. and when fires hit houses and towns, they burn up plastics and petrochemicals, releasing more carcinogenic and metallic substances into the atmosphere.\n",

      "should i be concerned indoors?\n",
      "staying indoors helps, but there are some additional actions to consider. \n",
      "if you have central air conditioning or can access a building with air conditioning, that helps filter out pollutants. also, hepa air filters cut down on particulate matter and don't have to cost a lot. the university of washington has a manual for building your own low cost air filter for roughly $20, which can dramatically lower fine particles. \n",

      "how to make your indoor air better when it's smoky outside\n",
      "\n",
      "since you're getting a hefty dose of air pollution from the outdoors, it's even more important not to expose yourself unnecessarily inside. former director of the center for climate, health, and the global environment at harvard t.h. chan school of public health and pediatrician aaron bernstein said people do this in ways they don't realize. they might idle their cars in attached garages, or use fragranced and ozone forming products, or run woodor gas burning stoves and fireplaces that pollute indoor air.\n",
      "what can my community do to reduce air pollution?\n",
      "the no. 1 action we can take for better air is addressing the root cause, not just the symptoms. after all, not everyone has control over their outdoor activities, and some communities and outdoor workers face astronomically higher risk from pollution than others. white americans contribute more to air pollution through their consumption of goods and services, yet black and hispanic americans tend to live in neighborhoods with lower air quality. \n",
      "one of the challenges in tackling climate change is that the carbon we're releasing now will stick around in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. that's fortunately not the case with particulate matter and ozone. they settle in a matter of days, so air can clear almost immediately once we address the sources of pollution. the world experienced how fast the air can improve when road and air travel came to sudden standstill early in the covid 19 pandemic. \n",
      "\"a lot of air pollution comes from controllable sources,\" holloway said. \"when we implement changes to our transportation, industries, energy systems, and roadways, all of those can immediately improve our air quality. certainly, we can't just make a policy change and have wildfires go away. but for many other sources of air pollution, there are a lot of available technologies to make the air cleaner.\"\n",
      "despite worsening wildfires, air quality has on the whole grown cleaner, especially within the united states over the last 40 years, as states have reduced major industrial sources of smog. environmental regulations have worked as intended to clean up the worst polluters. \n",
      "\"we have already made huge improvements in having cleaner vehicles and trucks, cleaner power plants, and cleaner industrial facilities,\" said holloway. \"and these have been deliberate choices that we've made.\" holloway believes \"this isn't a hopeless situation\" as long as society moves to tackling the sources of the problem.\n",
      "what other resources are out there?\n",

      "the summer solstice is upon us: wednesday, june 21, is the longest day of 2023, and the start of the summer season, for anyone living north of the equator. \n",
      "technically speaking, the summer solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the tropic of cancer, or 23.5 degrees north latitude. this will occur at exactly 10:57 am eastern wednesday. if you're a fan of sunlight, wearing shorts, eating ice cream, and enjoying all summer has to offer, this is likely a big day for you.\n",
      "below is a short scientific guide to the longest day of the year. \n",
      "1) why do we have a summer solstice, anyway?\n",
      "the summer and winter solstices, the seasons, and the changing length of daylight hours throughout the year are all due to one fact: earth spins on a tilted axis. \n",
      "the tilt — possibly caused by a massive object hitting earth billions of years ago — means that for half the year, the north pole is pointed toward the sun (as in the picture below). for the other half of the year, the south pole gets more light. \n",

      "a fun fact about the terminator: it's not the case that it splits the earth into even halves of light and dark. that's because our atmosphere bends sunlight a bit, essentially stretching it over a slightly greater area of land. this \"results in the land covered by sunlight having greater area than the land covered by darkness,\" the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa) explains. \n",
      "2) how many hours of sunlight will i get on the 21st?\n",
      "that depends on where you live. the farther north you are, the more sunlight you'll see during the solstice. alaska based climatologist brian brettschneider created this terrific guide (click to see some charts): the northernmost latitudes will see an entire 24 hours of sunlight, while most of the us will see anywhere between 14 and 16 hours.\n",

(you can easily make a similar image at home. all you need is a can, photo paper, some tape, and a pin. instructions here.)\n",

      "3) is the solstice the latest sunset of the year?\n",
      "not necessarily. just because june 21 is the longest day of the year for the northern hemisphere doesn't mean every location has its earliest sunrise or latest sunset on that day.\n",
      "if you live in washington, dc, the latest sunsets will start the day after the solstice, the 22nd. if you like sleeping in, that's arguably the most exciting day of the summer. timeanddate.com can tell you when the latest sunset will occur in your area. \n",
      "4) is the solstice really the first day of summer?\n",
      "well, depends: are you asking a meteorologist or an astronomer?\n",
      "meteorologically speaking, summer is defined as the hottest three months of the year, winter is the coldest three months, and the in between months are spring and fall.\n",
      "here's how noaa breaks it down:\n",
      "meteorological spring includes march, april, and may; meteorological summer includes june, july, and august; meteorological fall includes september, october, and november; and meteorological winter includes december, january, and february.\n",
      "so by this meteorological definition, summer has already started. but astronomically speaking, yes, summer begins when the sun is directly over the tropic of cancer, which is on the solstice. \n",
      "5) do i need to wear sunscreen? \n",
      "yes, you should wear sunscreen in the intense summer sun. though, as vox's julia belluz has reported, the research on whether sunscreen actually helps prevent the more aggressive form of skin cancer is lacking. as she writes:\n",
      "\n",
      "the us preventive services task force summed up the evidence on the health effects of sunscreen use ... [and] found that sunscreen reduced the incidence of squamous cell cancer, but that it had no effect on basal cell cancer. what's more, \"there are no direct data about the effect of sunscreen on melanoma incidence.\"\n",
      "still, research is always evolving and newer studies are emerging that show sunscreen can curb melanoma risk, such as this long term trial from australia.\n",
      "\n",
      "that said, it does definitely help prevent sunburn, which is unpleasant. for more on the science of sunscreen, read belluz's explainer.\n",
      "6) are there solstices and equinoxes on other planets? \n",
      "yes! all the planets in our solar system rotate on a tilted axis and therefore have seasons. some of these tilts are minor (like mercury, which is tilted at 2.11 degrees). but others are more like earth (23.5 degrees) or are even more extreme (uranus is tilted 98 degrees!). \n",
      "below, see a beautiful composite image of saturn on its equinox captured by the cassini spacecraft (rip) in 2009. the gas giant is tilted 27 degrees relative to the sun, and equinoxes on the planet are less frequent than on earth. saturn only sees an equinox about once every 15 years (because it takes saturn 29 years to complete one orbit around the sun).\n",

      "kimberly teehee, pictured in front of the cherokee national history museum in talequah, oklahoma, in april 2023, would be the first cherokee delegate to congress.\n",
      "katrina ward for the 19th\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "this story was originally published by the 19th, an independent nonprofit newsroom reporting at the intersection of gender, politics, and policy. sign up for their daily newsletter.\n",
      "tahlequah, ok — kim teehee can trace her ancestors on a scattered tour of the south — in georgia, up through the carolinas, and into tennessee. if a single place can divide a family's story in two, then for teehee's it might be blythe ferry, a crossing point for the tennessee river at the northwest corner of the cherokees' ancestral homeland, now tennessee. \n",
      "\"they moved across the water, basically symbolic of saying goodbye to the homelands forever,\" teehee said.  \n",
      "she recalled from her office in eastern oklahoma her ancestors' brutal and often deadly journey, the end point of what became known as the trail of tears — ꭰꭹꮅᏹ ꮧꭸꮵᏹꮔꮝꮤꮕꭲ — for thousands of cherokee people forcibly removed from their home. \n",
      "flanked by a traditional buffalo grass doll and sipping a diet coke, teehee traces the long thread of us federal action that shaped the next chapter of her story: federal action brought her family to a nearby town that has been marked by poverty and poor health. a federal program to assimilate native american children took her parents to a boarding school, and another sought to urbanize them with work in chicago. federal dollars would fund the preschool she attended and the hospital where her parents built careers.\n",
      "cherokee people and their tribal government, teehee believes, should have always had a seat at the table where these decisions were made: the very treaty that saw her ancestors forced off their lands almost 200 years ago also promised cherokee people a non voting delegate seat in the us house. now, the cherokee nation and teehee — who was appointed to the job by the tribe's leaders — are mounting an aggressive campaign to see that promise fulfilled.\n",
      "the cherokee nation's efforts to sit teehee in the house have bipartisan support, but it's not immediately clear when or how congressional leaders will take up the issue in earnest. if she gets this seat, with spots on key panels and the power to speak on the house floor, teehee hopes to help shape the next chapter of federal policy to benefit tribal governments and the people they serve. that includes addressing the epidemic of violence against native women, saving the cherokee language from extinction, and protecting funding for health care and housing.\n",
      "\"as a foundational matter in my life story, it's important to appreciate that so much of federal indian law and policy in this country has so directly impacted my family, personal story, and my journey,\" teehee said. \"i didn't see it as a young girl, but much later i could appreciate it all.\" \n",
      "the cherokee nation is the country's most populous tribe, with 450,000 citizens. teehee's seat in congress would mark the beginning of a new kind of relationship between the federal government and the cherokee nation, along with the tribal governments of the 573 other federally recognized tribes. that the first delegate from the cherokee nation would be a woman in a men dominated chamber would also send a public message about the tribe's values. \n",
      "\"we are matrilineal people. it informs a lot about how we care for our families and empower all generations of women to lead,\" taralee montgomery, a senior policy adviser for the cherokee nation told the 19th. \"the fact that the first delegate to be seated is a woman — that's obvious to cherokee culture.\"\n",
      "montgomery, 31, has worked alongside teehee for six years and described her as an \"absolute force.\" montgomery had just unveiled a new room designed to accommodate breastfeeding parents who work at the cherokee nation's offices in the tribe's capital of tahlequah or visit the building for government services, part of the tribe's efforts to make its government more family friendly. she credited teehee with empowering her to pursue the project. \"she means so much to young people like me,\" montgomery added.  \n",
      "montgomery said that until recently, many cherokee people didn't know about the provision of the 1835 treaty of new echota promising a cherokee delegate. since the campaign to seat teehee kicked off last fall, interest in seeing the treaty fulfilled has been building among cherokee people.\n",
      "\"the thing about kim teehee is that she will never meet a challenge that she won't take on and conquer,\" montgomery said. \"that tells you a lot about her role as a delegate.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "the durbin feeling language center, which opened last year, is housed in what used to be an old casino on the southern end of tahlequah. the immersive space, used to teach the cherokee language to children and adults, exudes joy, but also urgency. in 2019, cherokee people declared their language to be under a state of emergency, headed for extinction. \n",
      "of about 400,000 cherokee people living in the united states, a survey found that just over 2,000 can speak cherokee fluently. most of those speakers are over the age of 40, and every year, there are fewer. just 50 families are estimated to speak cherokee at home. \n",
      "teehee doesn't speak much cherokee, though her parents both grew up speaking it almost exclusively at home in the land allotments assigned to their families by the federal government near stilwell, oklahoma, about 30 minutes outside tahlequah. on the grounds of the salem baptist church in stilwell, rows of headstones mark the graves of teehee's family members.  \n",
      "why teehee is not fluent in cherokee can be traced back to federal policy — more specifically, a program that sought to urbanize native americans with the promise of work opportunities far from their reservations. the federal dollars that helped fund the durbin feeling language center are the beginning of the effort to repair the harms from that policy, and it's personal for teehee. \n",
      "teehee's parents met at sequoyah high school, which at the time was a us bureau of indian affairs boarding school. they weren't prohibited from speaking cherokee — a rule at many such schools — but it wasn't useful in communicating with students who hailed from different tribes from across the region. \n",
      "teehee's dad eventually dropped out to enroll in a federal work relocation program that took him to chicago, where teehee was born and spent the first decade of her life. \n",
      "\"the idea was to relocate you to find new opportunities. its intent, though, from congress, was to assimilate you into mainstream society,\" teehee said. \"there's a saying that has its origins in the indian boarding school era, which is, 'kill the indian, save the man.'\"\n",
      "chicago became one of the largest hubs of relocated indigenous americans in the united states. teehee grew up understanding she was cherokee, but the opportunity for work in chicago afforded to her parents meant the loss of formative years in her own cherokee community. through his job, teehee's dad was able to complete his high school diploma, which helped pave the way for a trade job back home in oklahoma, where the family yearned to be.\n",
      "many of those at the durbin feeling language center have similar family stories: they didn't grow up speaking the language at home but want to learn now; they want their own children to grow up fluent. \n",
      "kristen thomas, who leads a program that pairs native cherokee speakers with hopeful students, notes that the building itself is an immersive experience in the cherokee language. every sign and every book inside the 52,000 square foot facility — from the label on the fire extinguisher to a storybook about the solar system — is written in cherokee to serve its preschool through eighth grade language immersion school and its adult apprentice program. when its day care center opens later this year, the babies too will hear only cherokee. \n",
      "the school's main purpose is to create new cherokee speakers, but it is also a hub to foster pride in cherokee culture. inside the school's gym, there is a stack of wooden sticks with loops on one end used to play stickball, a sport played by several north american indigenous tribes that was the precursor to lacrosse. another space holds a demonstration kitchen to preserve traditional cherokee recipes, like ꮢꭹ & ꮷꮺꮵ, a dish made up of wild onions prepared with eggs and animal fat.\n",
      "the center was made possible by a combination of cherokee nation funds and federal dollars. earlier this year, president joe biden signed a law that funds a federal survey of both native language use and the funding needs of language revitalization efforts. it shares its namesake with the center: durbin feeling was the cherokee linguist who helped add the cherokee syllabary to word processing technology.\n",
      "thomas said that federal support for cherokee language revitalization efforts is crucial, given that language is \"the lens through which we view the world.\" she described teehee as an obvious choice to represent cherokee people in congress and urged house lawmakers to take action. \n",
      "\"there's that we deserve it, and that we've been promised this,\" thomas said. \"but even without that, this is such an obvious placement and way to strengthen the partnership with indian country.\" \n",
      "teehee said the effort to protect native american languages would be one of her priorities as the seated cherokee delegate to congress. the cherokee nation believes that federal support to protect the language would help directly address its own damage to native american language and culture. \n",
      "\"i always say i'm a product of federal indian policy and relocation, getting us to another state where acculturation was the goal,\" teehee said. \"but i'm also a product of its failure because the program highly underestimated the attachments that indians have toward their communities and our families.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "while in college, teehee joined the cherokee nation's government office to work as an intern under wilma mankiller, the first woman elected as principal chief of the cherokee nation.\n",
      "mankiller, who died in 2010, became teehee's longtime mentor. teehee described mankiller as an exacting boss who nevertheless taught her to be patient when listening to people's struggles and to welcome them with empathy. \n",
      "in 1985, mankiller had become just the third chief elected to the role since cherokee people regained the power to elect their own chiefs in the 1970s. during her tenure, mankiller reshaped the tribe's relationship with the federal government to protect its sovereignty, and focused on health care and women's leadership.\n",
      "mankiller, in a speech at emory university, told a story about an encounter between cherokee people and a united states treaty negotiation team. the us cadre was made up of men, prompting the cherokees to ask, \"where are your women?\" \n",
      "teehee had been set on going to medical school, but mankiller urged her to attend law school. afterward, teehee felt pulled to a career advocating for the power and sovereignty of the cherokee nation and its people. she decided washington, dc, was the place to do it after hearing one of the tribe's lobbyists describe quashing what they considered anti indian legislation in congress.\n",
      "in 2009, after a decade working on native american issues in dc, teehee would be tapped for her highest profile job to date as the nation's first ever senior policy adviser for native american affairs under the administration of president barack obama. in that role, she pushed for legislation that would strengthen accountability for people who commit crimes against native american women.\n",
      "more than four in five american indian and alaska native women — 84.3 percent — have experienced violence in their lifetime; more than half have experienced sexual violence, according to a 2016 federal study. murder is the third leading cause of death for native american women. \n",
      "advocates have long criticized federal and state law enforcement agencies for not doing enough to respond to missing person reports and reports of violence related to native american women and girls.\n",
      "the national indigenous women's resource center blames the high incidence of violence against indigenous women on the erosion of tribal sovereignty and a complicated justice system facing victims and their families that has allowed perpetrators to move on without facing accountability. \n",
      "\"in the 1970s and '80s, as tribes are starting to grow more economically, and creating more jobs, and creating resorts and casinos, and hotels and golf courses, that's inviting more non indians on the reservation. when you don't have criminal jurisdiction over that non indian, that's an enormous gap,\" teehee said. \n",
      "\"and then when you combine that with the fact that, you know, probably about half of native american women are married to non native spouses, you leave an environment that's vulnerable for the rates that we have of domestic violence in indian country.\" \n",
      "a tool to combat those astounding rates of violence was included in the 2013 reauthorization of the violence against women act. it gave tribal governments power to prosecute non indigenous people who commit domestic violence or dating violence against indigenous women in indian country.\n",
      "teehee said the measure found a receptive ear in congress in part thanks to her years of relationship building and education on native american issues with lawmakers and congressional staff.\n",
      "after a stint at the democratic national committee helping the party navigate its relationship with native american tribes and advocacy groups, teehee pivoted to congress in 1998, becoming a senior adviser and the sole staffer for the first native american caucus in the house. \n",
      "the caucus worked to educate members on indian issues, \"as well as try to kill anti indian proposals,\" teehee said. often, positions that weren't favorable to native american tribes came from lack of information about how proposals would impact them.\n",
      "\"i felt that that was my job to fill gaps,\" teehee said. \"if you don't have time to get to know an issue, you can't write about it for your boss, i will do it. and i don't need credit for it. i'll give you a letter. i'll give you a memo. i'll set up meetings for you. i'll give you backgrounders.\" \n",
      "when the time came for negotiations surrounding the violence against women act and the provisions dealing with tribal jurisdiction in 2012, teehee said, the administration had a congress that was really informed and supportive of issues impacting native american people. \n",
      "\"if we don't do it now, we're going to lose that learning curve,\" teehee told the administration at the time. \n",
      "while she's not a seated delegate in congress, teehee has continued advocating on behalf of the cherokee nation in congress and before the white house. last year, biden signed a reauthorization of the same law that expanded the list of crimes over which tribal governments have jurisdiction to include sexual violence, sex trafficking, and stalking. \n",
      "it's ongoing work. teehee said that the list of issues impacting tribal governments is long and the list of champions in congress is ever fluctuating. the next battle for tribal governments will be to secure funding for their most basic operations. about 90 percent of all federal funding that flows to tribal governments is discretionary and subject to constant reauthorization. teehee has been advocating for that funding to become a permanent expenditure out of reach of politicking or a government shutdown. \n",
      "\"that's education, that's housing, that's food,\" teehee said. \n",
      "\n",
      "set back from a busy commercial street by a lush green lawn in the heart of tahlequah sits an ornate two story brick building. this structure replaced a wooden one that burned down during the civil war and was finished in 1869 — 40 years after the forced relocation of cherokee people to this land — and became the capitol of the cherokee nation. in the 1900s, when oklahoma became a state and the federal government sought to dissolve the tribal governments, the cherokee legislative body lost its power and the building became the property of the local county government. cherokee people wouldn't elect their own chief for another 70 years. \n",
      "one question that comes up often in discussions about seating a cherokee nation delegate in congress is why it took nearly 200 years for the tribal government to name someone to the post and move to formally seat them in washington. \n",
      "\"when we get to our new homeland, we are simply trying to survive and rebuild a great society,\" said chuck hoskin, the principal chief of the cherokee nation. like the old capitol, now the cherokee history museum, cherokee people would go through periods of destruction and disempowerment for the next 150 years. \n",
      "in the 1970s, when cherokee people elected their first principal chief and the federal government gave the tribe more financial autonomy, hoskin said a period of rebuilding began that led to the moment the tribe finds itself in now — where it has the political connections and resources to demand its seat in congress. \n",
      "hoskin, who was reelected to the job this year, oversees the tribe's government.\n",
      "those efforts appeared on the brink of success at the end of last year, following a months long public campaign to pressure the united states to fulfill its treaty obligation, including intense lobbying of congressional leaders and dozens of interviews with the press. the campaign gained momentum from a congressional hearing in november, where lawmakers of both parties acknowledged the treaty and expressed support for exploring different avenues to seat teehee. support rose to the highest ranks when then house speaker nancy pelosi committed to finding a \"path\" to welcome a cherokee nation delegate into the house.\n",
      "republican rep. tom cole of oklahoma, who now chairs the panel handling this issue, the rules committee, called teehee \"a very good friend\" during the hearing. cole's office did not respond to a   about when his committee may take up the issue again.\n",
      "an aide to rep. jim mcgovern, the highest ranking democrat on the panel, who spearheaded the november hearing, said mcgovern continues to believe that a cherokee nation delegate should be seated in the house and reaffirmed the lawmaker's commitment to advocating for the issue.\n",
      "the aide said mcgovern was frustrated that the issue didn't advance in the 117th congress.\n",
      "into december, teehee and the cherokee nation's leaders held onto hope that democratic leaders would act on the issue before their time in the majority ran out. they did not. \n",
      "the house's new gop majority meant the cherokee nation's delegate campaign had to start over in the work of educating lawmakers. they also needed to address outstanding concerns, which boil down to four critical questions.\n",
      "the first and most consequential is whether seating the cherokee delegate can be done with a simple house resolution, or if the process will require approval from the senate and the president — a lengthier and more politically involved process.\n",
      "second, some lawmakers have wondered whether congress should have a delegate who is appointed. the house's delegates representing us territories are elected, but teehee was appointed by the cherokee nation's tribal government. (the cherokee nation says it's within its sovereign rights to decide how it picks its own representative.)\n",
      "the third is whether sitting teehee would give double representation in congress to cherokee people, who are already technically represented by whoever their local representative is. \n",
      "lastly, congress would also need to decide how to handle the claims made by other cherokee bands to the delegate seat. on the side of tahlequah's main artery, a large ad on a bright electronic billboard shows a cherokee woman alongside a plea to congress to seat a cherokee delegate. but the woman is not kim teehee — it's tori holland of the united keetoowah band of cherokee indians of oklahoma, which has its own treaty claim to a delegate seat in congress. there may be another. \n",
      "all are questions that cherokee nation lawyers and congress's research arm have studied.\n",
      "\"it's an enormous undertaking to educate again,\" teehee said. \"i feel like i'm back at being that staffer that used to research, write memos, write letters, write colloquies, figure out how to message to d's and to r's. you know, i'm back in that space again. \"\n",
      "just outside the lawn of the cherokee history museum in a busy part of tahlequah is a sitting area and art installation lush with lavender and ornamental grass. tall murals feature the work of traci rabbit, a cherokee artist who says her work tries to capture the essence of the native american woman: \"from the proud lift of her chin to the strands of hair caught in the wind, she appears to weather all storms.\" \n",
      "it's sunny, the bright colors of the murals are popping, and the women in them seem to float above the ground. the mural behind where teehee sits for our interview is called \"cherokee traditions\" and shows a woman wearing a traditional feather cape; only a handful of cherokee artists who can make them are left.\n",
      "if her bid to be seated as the delegate from the cherokee nation to congress comes to fruition, teehee said, the moment will be bittersweet: the cost was the home, lives, and tears of her ancestors. hundreds of thousands of cherokees never saw the promise fulfilled. \n",
      "\"i feel it now just talking about it — you know, how proud i am to represent my nation. but then i can't help but think about what we lost in the process, too,\" teehee said.  \n",
      "if she gets to take the oath of office, teehee will place her hand on her own bible, written in the cherokee language. her first choice would have been one of her grandfather's old cherokee bibles, but so many of the family's documents and books burned to ash in a 2016 house fire — including a little green cherokee hymn book cherished by her dad. the sound of cherokee hymns reminds teehee of traveling to her parents' home for family funerals. \n",
      "her parents are now in their late 70s and suffering from serious illnesses. teehee said they continue to be a key source of motivation for her work. \n",
      "\"i think of how proud i would be for my parents to be able to be there with me and to be alive to see it as cherokee speakers. i just hope it does happen in their lifetime.\"\n",

      "correction, june 28, 8:44 am: an earlier version of this article misspelled the name and affiliation of the school teehee's parents attended. it was sequoyah high school, and the boarding school was run by the us bureau of indian affairs. the article also misstated the type of federal dollars used to fund the durbin feeling language center; it is us bureau of indian affairs child care dollars.\n",

(ap photo/jose luis magana, file)the associated pressthe \" rage giving \" did not last. abortion access groups who received a windfall of donations following the supreme court's overturning of roe v. wade one year ago say those emergency grants have ended and individual and foundation giving has dropped off. after the dobbs decision, some major funders of abortion access also have ended or shifted funding from organizations working in states where abortion is now banned, said naa amissah hammond, senior director of grantmaking with groundswell fund, which funds grassroots groups organizing for reproductive justice.women's health and foster care nonprofits, who expected increased demand in areas where access to abortion has been eliminated or restricted, say they also haven't seen increased support.holly calvasina said her experience as director of development at the reproductive health clinic choices in memphis, tennessee, might provide an explanation. like many working in the reproductive rights sector, calvasina said she tried to prepare for the increase in need, even before a draft of the supreme court decision was leaked in may last year. while some funders saw the writing on the wall and stepped up support, others wanted to wait and see. \"i think (that) really speaks to kind of a fundamental issue with philanthropy and responding to an emergent crisis,\" calvasina said. \"philanthropy moves really slowly and human rights crises unfold quickly.\" the rollercoaster of giving also showed up for choices in the $ , in donations to their annual spring appeal last year. that's up from $ , in . this year, the appeal raised $ , . organizations in states where abortion has been banned or limited have needed to pivot, said marsha jones, executive director of the afiya center, based in dallas. her organization used donations received after the dobbs decision to expand its birthing center, but she said funders are less interested in supporting maternal health than they were in supporting advocacy and practical support for abortions. she argues, as she has for years, that supporting reproductive justice is more than supporting abortion access.\"it is literally people wanting to choose full bodily autonomy,\" she said of those choosing to carry a pregnancy to term and others who do not. data on last year's charitable giving to any sector is hard to come by. the pandemic has slowed the public release of donor reports to the irs, though a delay of up to two years was typical even before covid hit. donations to human services and public society benefit organizations, sectors that could include abortion access nonprofits, both declined in , while donations to health organizations increased %, which is actually a decline when adjusted for inflation, according to the giving usa report released last week.but a special layer of opacity exists around funding for abortion access. many donors fund anonymously, sometimes requiring grantees not to publicly disclose the source. the largest historic funder, the susan thompson buffett foundation, eventually makes gifts public through tax filings, but the organization does not comment on support for abortion access and did not respond to questions about whether or how its funding strategy changed in response to the dobbs decision. another large funder, the david and lucile packard foundation, said it is shifting its grantmaking after dobbs. it stopped funding sex education programs in schools and ended funding for abortion services that closed due to new laws. the foundation also added $ . million in funding last year to \"shore up providers in safe haven states,\" and to help people find and access abortion care.the william and flora hewlett foundation said it provides steady support to grantees in all states to fund abortion care where it remains legal or advocacy against bans.in general, giving to organizations specifically serving women and girls represents less than % of all donations, according to a research project of the women's philanthropy institute at indiana university's lilly family school of philanthropy.calvasina thinks anonymous funding, especially from the largest foundations, perpetuates inequality within the movement. others in the sector said donors have many reasons for wanting to be anonymous, including to avoid being targeted by groups opposing abortion. one measure of the potential amount of funding available to reproductive health organizations is the extent of gifts from donor advised funds hosted by the silicon valley community foundation to planned parenthood affiliates across the country. those donations exceeded $ million in , according to data from candid, a nonprofit that compiles information about charitable giving. the foundation declined to speak about the gifts, citing its policy not to comment on daf grants. seeing a drop in giving after a major event is not that unusual, said una osili, associate dean for research and international programs at the lilly family school.\"if you think about the decision to give, whether it's to a natural disaster or crisis, people hear about it and they want to participate to make a difference,\" osili said. danielle gletow, founder and executive director at one simple wish, a nonprofit connecting donors with foster children who have specific requests, said people are seeking out groups like hers offering direct support. but she worries that abortion access restrictions may further strain the foster care system. in texas, where the state's child welfare program is so overwhelmed that children sometimes sleep in office buildings, foster care workers fear the state's strict laws on abortion may force women to have children for whom they cannot care, adding to the foster children population.\"i don't think it's possible to break anything worse when it's already broken, if i'm being honest,\" gletow said. \"this is a system that's incredibly broken.\"philanthropic support has surged to states such as new mexico, which passed laws protecting access to abortion and shielding abortion providers while bordering texas and oklahoma, where abortion is now banned. a coalition of local groups publicly asked incoming funders and groups to coordinate with them as recently as february.charlene bencomo, executive director of bold futures, a leader of the coalition, said they ask new providers to accept medicaid, which can cover abortion in the state, and to offer reproductive health services outside of abortion care.\"we continue to look for a higher quality of care, a better quality of care for our folks in new mexico and for those who need to come here to access care that they cannot in their home state,\" bencomo said. amissah hammond, of the groundswell fund, said she's waiting to see if funders who responded with emergency or one time grants last year will continue to fund abortion access over the long term. for funders concerned about legal liabilities, she suggested they offer general operating support, rather than project based grants, and accept updates over the phone. \"we're learning a lot from our peer funders who have been funding in global contexts,\" she said. \"where work for reproductive rights, health and justice has been criminalized for a long time and where lgbtq rights has been criminalized and work, frankly, for democracy has been criminalized.\" ___associated press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the ap's collaboration with the conversation

      "Title: From ‘brain death’ to innovator, the Ukraine war has transformed NATO\n",
      "ever since president vladimir putin gave the order for russian troops to invade ukraine, the international response has understandably focused on how best to end the land war. that has meant sending conventional military hardware – tanks, missile systems, artillery – and training ukrainian soldiers. not bad for an organization france's president emmanuel macron warned in was facing \"brain death.\" russia's aggression hasn't been restricted to the battlefield. even before the invasion, nato officials noted a rise in non conventional warfare aimed at ukraine and other western targets. since the start of the war, disinformation, energy restrictions and cyberattacks on infrastructure have all been weaponized by the kremlin to justify and advance its war. \"a weapon, by its broadest definition, is something that you can use to coerce someone into doing what you want them to do. you can put a gun to their head, you can blackmail them, you can spread disinformation to turn others against them or you can turn off the energy to their house,\" david van weel, nato's assistant secretary general for emerging security challenges, told cnn. those weapons are not only aimed at the target, in this case ukraine. \"russia claims that nato promised never to expand to the east after the dissolution of the soviet union. and although we've been debunking that for years, you see that this keeps coming back. and there's definitely a percentage of our population that falls for this kind of disinformation,\" van weel said. these sorts of attacks can have very real world impact, van weel explained, referencing a cyberattack that took out german wind farms last year. it is commonly accepted that energy security has been a key feature of the war in ukraine, with russia using energy as a weapon against western allies. much of the western focus since the start of the war has been on defense spending. it is no secret that the vast majority of nato allies have for years fallen far short of their % target, something that has long infuriated officials at nato's brussels hq. a common explanation as to why this happened is that in the post soviet era, western countries became complacent, feeling that they had won the cold war. \"countries far away from invasion themselves felt that distance would lead security, and they could continue to ignore the growing urgency of investment in hard security,\" said keir giles, a senior fellow at the london based chatham house think tank. \"spending % of gdp on defence was supposed to be a baseline – the minimum credible level of defence budget. over time, cynical countries who didn't feel at risk pointed to the spending of % to claim that they were doing enough on defense. but in reality, there was no stipulation on what that % – even if they reached that threshold – was spent on, so it was never an indication of how prepared or useful they might be,\" giles added. this inertia has also held back the west's ability to deal with cyber and non conventional threats from adversaries, including russia and china. to those working in these areas, it came as no surprise that russia had been so successful interfering in the elections of other nations or that china had so successfully spread disinformation in western countries during the pandemic. peter caddick adams, a former official nato historian, explains that it is extremely difficult for nations not currently at war to behave as though they are. this war mentality is key when dealing with threats that are not boots on the ground, but are just as aggressive and exist in places that are harder to see. \"nato could only go as fast as members were willing to invest. if you are a peacetime democracy, it's very difficult to switch to that footing and counterattack your opponent's non conventional attacks. if you are not at war, there will be a limit on what you and your public are willing to spend on things they can't see,\" he told cnn. while all eyes will be on whether or not sweden becomes the nd country to join nato at its summit next month, the collective defense alliance will also use its meeting to show that it's prepared for its future. it will announce the nato innovation fund, a project that will bring of nato's members together with private business in the technology sector. it will make the participating nations limited partners, meaning they will not seek majority stakes in companies and allow the companies to carry on working with other investors, including from outside nato. why is an organization like nato taking such a relaxed approach to developing technologies that will soon become so critical to national and international security? \"innovation used to come from the defense sector. we think of gps and the internet. but that world has completely changed around that now. innovation comes from start ups and academic ecosystems, not from big companies or governments anymore,\" said van weel. the innovation fund is the second major nato plan to deal with non conventional and emerging threats to launch this year. the defence innovation accelerator for the north atlantic (diana) launched its first pilot challenge program on june . will this push to better prepare the west for whatever the next decade looks like succeed? china, after all, is becoming more hostile and there is no certainty as to how the russia's war in ukraine ends, nor if it spills beyond ukraine's borders. and if the war does end, is there a risk that allies revert to the complacency of the past? giles argues that nato is dealing with the consequences of decades when its members \"had the luxury of pretending that the problem of defense and security had gone away.\" russia's invasion \"ought to have proven beyond any doubt that europe is under threat and needs to invest in protecting itself, both in terms of conventional and non conventional security,\" he said. and while politicians are promising renewed spending and attention right now, he fears that convincing the public this is essential, even after ukraine, is \"a leap of imagination that seems beyond the capabilities of most western politicians.\" caddick adams says that ukraine provides a window for nato to prove that the alliance can act effectively without engaging in war itself, thereby making its members more comfortable with spending in the future. \"ukraine has become a springboard basically for nato's experiments in this non conventional stuff. without engaging russia, nato has enabled ukraine to try some of the things nato would like to do but politically cannot do. it answers a lot of questions about warmongering or german uneasiness, but militarily in terms of capabilities,\" he said. it's easy to forget exactly how recently macron made his \"brain death\" comments. the manner in which the alliance was caught cold by putin's escalation might lend some credibility to that view. but the alliance's unity has been one of the least expected and most welcome aspects of the west's response to the war in ukraine. and the relative stability of the politics within the alliance has created windows for nato to try new things and get the money to do so. however, officials are also aware that this collegiate approach might not last forever. and it's not the unknown factor of how long the war persists and countries losing interest that worries some officials the most. it's the prospect of elections happening across the alliance in which the issue of ukraine could become a wedge issue – including the small matter of the race for the white house in .  \n",

      "Title: Bizarre and chaotic 36 hours in Russia feels like the beginning of the end for Putin\n",
      "desperately projecting that everything is as it was, the kremlin is only emphasizing how much has changed. these were hours that provided a glimpse of the end of russian president vladimir putin's rule. almost every action was improbable, at best a week ago – much was inconceivable, months ago. a loyal henchman slams the premise of the invasion, then claims an airstrike targeted his troops, before taking a major military town without clashes, prigozhin said, and then marching to within a few hundred miles of moscow. but suddenly he executes a baffling reversal, turning back to avoid bloodshed, as the kremlin claims alexander lukashenko, the president of belarus whom putin seems to treat with contempt, brokered a dramatic reprieve, in which the insurrectionist who has his armor bound for moscow, now opts for exile in minsk. even as the dust settles, it still makes little sense. it is important to remember we have yet to hear from yevgeny prigozhin that he has accepted exile in belarus and see evidence his units have genuinely all stood down. he is an open proliferator of misinformation. we should be equally suspicious of the apparent bow with which kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov tried to tie this startling episode up with on saturday night. two hours earlier, wagner were at the gates of the capital (almost), and then suddenly everything is forgiven. there are large parts of this story missing. we may never learn what they are. many emotions could have altered prigozhin's course. was the advance north too easy? did he accept entering the capital would leave his men vulnerable, even to a weak russian military response? were the regular military not joining him in large enough number? did he believe a climbdown would only grow his support? while on the surface, prigozhin's climbdown makes him appear weak, even finished, he has been the decision maker over the past hours. putin has been left reacting. silent initially, and then bombastically angry and confident, promising \"inevitable punishment\" for the \"scum.\" but hours later, this was all forgotten. putin's emotional state were it known is arguably less revealing than his actions. by letting prigozhin go, and apparently sweeping the entire insurrection under the carpet, he's appeared the weakest yet in years. it is possible his special services will now pursue wagner and its supporters, slowly, away from the glare of the last two days. yet the kremlin's solution to the problem was to climb down too. it's a move so antipathetic to everything putin stands for, it can only suggest he had no other choice: that he lacked the forces to be sure he could hold prigozhin back. that is perhaps the larger lesson of the so called march of justice. not that a mercenary boss didn't send a modest sized force into moscow to execute a coup, but that the kremlin had to let him go. putin's vulnerability is assured putin's position was clearly weakening because of the war's catastrophic mismanagement. but how he would be removed what possible circumstances could permit that was something that eluded officials and analysts. this was not a likely option. but now it has happened, we have a glimpse behind the thickset curtain the kremlin relies upon to hide its infighting, incompetence and frailty, allowing it to project an outsized confidence – a post soviet omnipotence. it's pretty ugly in there it seems. now the rest of the world has seen this too – from ukraine to nato to putin's allies. notably some friends were quiet: kazakhstan and iran – both of whom owe russia a past debt – called this an \"internal matter.\" that is not unqualified support. we can only guess whether the thought of prigozhin in charge will cause such panic in the elite country houses of suburban moscow that support for putin sustains. yet his vulnerability is now assured, for the first time in years – two decades in which he has accrued plentiful enemies and debts. (it is ridiculous to maintain the last two days have been an elaborate charade designed to somehow improve putin's position or provide a pretext for escalation. this is an entirely internal affair, distracting from the urgent needs of the war. making the kremlin head seem this unequivocally weak can in no way strengthen his position). so where does this leave russia and its anxious adversaries? we can't know what comes next, but it is likely to follow the explosively erratic pattern of the last two days. prigozhin may vanish for a few months. putin may make some changes in his military staff. things may seem \"normal.\" but they have absolutely changed and a post putin world – and the dramatic force needed to impose it – has been glimpsed. it feels like the beginning of the end for him. the most acute catalyst to any change will be the impact this bizarre drama has on the ukraine frontlines. it is impossible to imagine that a series of fluctuations in russia's military presence has not weakened defensive positions in the south and east – the very places where ukraine is pushing forwards. the most optimistic assessment you could make is that russian military morale must have felt a hiccup while watching its commander in chief and most prominent military figure engage in a hour game of chicken. would you genuinely give your life on the russian front lines this weekend, given the mess you observe in the higher command? ukraine claims to be already pushing forward. it is too early to know what impact the justice march has had on the war. but the kremlin must be acutely aware of the damage to both the positions of putin and prigozhin if this conflict – which moscow has framed as an existential battle against nato – is ultimately lost. perhaps that stark recognition was quietly feeding the bizarre decisions and reversals as wagner fighters made such easy progress on saturday north on the m highway to moscow. \n",

      "wagner group forces took out six russian helicopters and another aircraft during yevgeny prigozhin's short lived rebellion, ukrainian officials said sunday, in a development that could hand ukraine a defensive edge in the fighting.according to the kyiv independent, yurii ihnat, a ukrainian air force spokesperson, emphasized the benefit to ukraine, saying: \"mi transport helicopters are powerful hardware that really helps the russian army in its war against ukraine.\"reports differ on the exact specifications of the destroyed aircraft. ihnat has said that wagner took out two attack helicopters and four transport aircraft, while pro kremlin military bloggers were cited by the kyiv independent as saying three of them were electronic warfare helicopters. the open source weapons tracker site oryx, whose helicopter tally matches that of the cited military bloggers, said it had documented evidence of the following russian losses: a mi attack helicopter, a ka attack helicopter, three mi electronic warfare helicopters, one mi transport, and an il m airborne command post.it added that prigozhin had captured a russian mrap patrol vehicle and a tigr m infantry mobility vehicle. oryx said that prigozhin had lost two trucks, two technical vehicles, and an infantry mobility vehicle to the russian army proper. after an astonishing hours, which saw prigozhin direct his militia into action on russian soil and then make a rush toward moscow, russian leadership and the paramilitary boss reached a wary agreement in which prigozhin was exiled to belarus.hanna malyar, ukraine's deputy defense minister, told the associated press: \"the enemy's weakness is always a window of opportunity. it allows us to take the advantage.\"it's too soon to see how the chaos between wagner and the russian military establishment will affect things on the ground, she said.on sunday, as the wagner debacle unfolded in russia, ukrainian soldiers near bakhmut told agence france presse that it did not appear to have affected the situation there.\"as it attacked yesterday, russia continued to attack today,\" a soldier identified only as nazar told the outlet. nonetheless, the loss of six helicopters in a single weekend is significant.in one year of defending against russia, ukraine had shot down about of russia's helicopters, forbes reported in february. at that time, russia had about helicopters — around half of them attack helicopters — based near its western borders, the kyiv post reported.as the recent chaos unfolded in russia, ukraine said it had managed to push forward in its counteroffensive. as of early monday local time, ukraine's military said it had advanced half a mile around the ukrainian city of bakhmut, the guardian reported. nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said monday that prigozhin's rebellion was evidence putin had made a \"big strategic mistake\" in invading ukraine last year, the outlet added. \n",

      "the kremlin has forged a deal with wagner group boss yevgeny prigozhin to defuse the mercenary group's uprising on saturday.in exchange for prigozhin's exile to belarus, the mercenary leader won't be prosecuted, the associated press reported, citing a kremlin spokesperson.the reported agreement comes after a paramilitary rebellion on saturday in which the wagner group marched across russia before suddenly turning around just miles from moscow. prigozhin said he didn't want to shed russian blood.kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov announced saturday that prigozhin — and the troops who follow him — will not face criminal prosecution as part of the deal. he also said those troops who did not join in the uprising would be offered defense ministry contracts. saturday's rebellion marked the strongest threat to president vladimir putin's power in over years. prigozhin had dubbed his procession towards moscow a \"march for justice,\" and made baseless claims that russia's defense minister had ordered an air strike on the wagner group on friday and killed large numbers of troops. the kremlin denied the allegation.earlier on saturday, prigozhin posted a voice note to his telegram channel, calling his , troops \"patriots\" and defending their cause. \"we don't want the country to continue to live any longer in corruption, deceit, and bureaucracy,\" prigozhin said, according to a reuters translation.belarus president aleksandr lukashenko, a close putin ally who has also long known prigozhin, spent all day saturday negotiating with prigozhin, according to the new york times. prigozhin was once, himself, a close putin ally, but tensions have grown high since russia's invasion of ukraine in . prigozhin evenly openly criticized russia's invasion of ukraine as a \"racket\" in a public statement last week, the times reported. though he didn't directly criticize putin, he publicly refuted russia's justification for the invasion. \"the war wasn't needed to return russian citizens to our bosom, nor to demilitarize or denazify ukraine,\" prigozhin said. \"the war was needed so that a bunch of animals could simply exult in glory.\"the wagner group's rebellion first began friday. by the next day, putin had formally accused prigozhin of treason and issued a warrant for his arrest.moscow had been bracing for violence, with residents fleeing, city officials warning people to stay home, and workers destroying highways leading into the city.by saturday, the wagner group had apparently gained control of military headquarters in rostov on don, a city miles south of moscow where russia's operations in ukraine are managed, according to the associated press. on saturday, the mercenary group was reportedly also in lipesk province, just miles south of moscow. \n",

      "Title: An epic fight over how real-estate agents get paid could transform the housing market forever\n",
      "let's say you're ready to sell your house. trying to find a buyer and sifting through offers sounds like a nightmare, so you hire a real estate agent. in exchange for their guidance, you agree to pay the agent % of the sale price, which they say is industry standard. your agent advises you that in order to drum up sufficient interest in your home, you should also promise to cover the commission for the buyer's agent — another % of the sale price. this seems like a hefty chunk of change, but you go along with the setup since you almost certainly couldn't navigate the transaction without some professional help. you get some glossy photos taken, hang a sign in your front yard, and wait for the offers to pour in. when the deal closes, however, you don't cut a check to both agents. instead you give % of your proceeds to your agent, who then splits that with the buyer's broker.as the money makes its way to all the players in the transaction, you may wonder: why does it work this way? according to the plaintiffs of two massive class action lawsuits, this circuitous method of paying real estate agents is all part of a far reaching scheme that is bilking home sellers out of billions of dollars every year. the heart of the problem, according to the lawsuits, are the multiple listing services — local, online databases where agents share photos and detailed information about homes for sale. the mlss are a central component of the us real estate market, and the most critical tools that licensed agents have at their disposal — in fact, they're one of the most persuasive reasons for even hiring an agent in the first place. in order to access an mls, listing agents must agree that money from the sale will follow the prescribed, serpentine path. but now two multibillion dollar lawsuits — sitzer et al. v. nar et al. and moehrl et al. v. nar et al. — threaten to upend the entire system. the plaintiffs, representing a large swath of home sellers around the country, are accusing the national association of realtors and some of the country's largest brokerages of using mls rules to charge exorbitant fees and unfairly prop up agent commissions. these lawsuits are finally coming to a head after simmering for several years, and if the plaintiffs succeed, they could rewrite the rules of how agents get paid. the seller might no longer pay out both agents' commissions after the sale closes. instead, a buyer would pay their agent directly. proponents say these changes would increase competition among agents, dramatically lower commissions, and potentially save consumers as much as $ billion to $ billion a year. the defendants, led by the nar, argue that the current setup actually favors consumers by providing broad access to an efficient real estate market. despite the potentially earthshaking consequences, most local real estate agents — who, to be fair, have more pressing short term concerns — have largely ignored the cases. but if the plaintiffs prevail, these cases could radically reshape what buying and selling a home looks like, and they represent the biggest existential threat to the real estate industry today.when you buy a home with the help of a real estate agent, paying for their services will probably be among the least of your worries — and agents are happy to have it that way. the rules are designed to make their commissions as inconspicuous as possible: since the seller pays both agents, the buyer doesn't pay anything up front. until just a few years ago, realtors were even allowed to tell buyers that their services were free. of course, that's not really the case. the buyer is the one coming up with the money for the property, after all. but the illusion helps agents preserve their commissions, the plaintiffs argue, since buyers don't have to think about the fees, and sellers are incentivized to promise high commissions in order to get brokers to look favorably upon their properties. the nar argues that this is the most efficient arrangement. buyers don't have to pay out of pocket for their agent, and sellers benefit from closing the deal without delays over which agent gets paid what. but detractors, including the plaintiffs in the two lawsuits, say this setup forces sellers to pay inflated commissions to buyers' agents in order to generate interest in their homes. and they say the defendants in the case — the nar along with large brokerages like re/max, keller williams, anywhere real estate (formerly realogy), and homeservices of america — have benefited from this shell game. ultimately, the rules of the mls are the sticking points. what agents collectively refer to as the mls is actually a web of roughly independent, local databases around the country. nearly % of these mlss are owned or operated by local realtor associations, according to court filings, and are governed by rules mandated by the nar. the reach of the mls is incredibly powerful — nearly % of sellers last year listed their properties on the databases, according to the nar. in exchange for this access, the nar requires sellers who list on an mls to agree to the \"cooperative compensation rule\" — the expectation that the seller will pay a commission to the buyer's agent.the rule is the primary target of the two class action lawsuits, both of which are seeking billions of dollars in damages. sellers, the plaintiffs argue, had no choice but to list their homes on an mls. this, in turn, meant they were forced to agree to the rules of the databases — including paying exorbitant commissions to buyers' agents who might choose to pass over their properties if they didn't. the first case to reach trial will be sitzer et al. v. nar et al., which was filed in missouri and is scheduled for an october trial. total damages in the case could reach nearly $ billion. in the larger of the two cases, moehrl et al. v. nar et al., damages could total more than $ billion. that case, which was filed in illinois, would likely reach a trial in the first half of . brokerages named in the suits either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.stephen brobeck, a senior fellow at the consumer federation of america, told me that one of the biggest problems identified in the cases is what's known as \"steering.\" since agents representing buyers can see the promised commission for each home in the mls, they can discourage their clients from viewing properties with unsatisfactory paydays. the nar doesn't set a minimum commission that listing brokers need to promise to their counterparts on the buyer's side — technically, it could be as little as $ . but the going rate is typically between . % and % of the total sale price, so anything below that amount means the sellers' home could be less likely to get traction. \"they not only have to pay a buyer's agent commission, but they can't negotiate that commission,\" brobeck said of sellers. \"because if they lower that commission, research has shown that the house is less likely to be shown by the buyer agents.\" one study found that properties listed with sub . % commission rates were % less likely to sell and took % longer to sell.while the plaintiffs in these cases take aim at other rules that they say hinder negotiations over compensation, their primary goal is to \"decouple\" the commissions paid to the buyer's agent and the seller's agent. if each party just pays for their own agent directly, the theory goes, there will be more transparency and more incentives for clients to negotiate with their brokers. \"it just doesn't make any sense for the seller to have to pay the buyer's agent,\" brobeck told me.katie johnson, the chief legal officer for the nar, told me the current model benefits both buyers and sellers by encouraging cooperation between agents.\"making an offer of compensation is good for the seller, because that is their listing broker making an offer to all the other professionals in the area to go to work, put your time and effort in finding this buyer, because you'll get paid for the work,\" johnson told me. \"i think that's pretty intuitive.\" buyers, meanwhile, \"benefit tremendously\" because they don't have to pay out of pocket for those expenses, johnson said. the nar and its predecessors have periodically faced legal challenges over industry practices that critics say discourage competition and lead to inflated broker commissions. while the internet has broadened access to real estate listings and the competition among agents has intensified over the past two decades, commission rates have remained stubbornly high relative to countries with comparable housing markets such as australia, the netherlands, and the united kingdom. nicholas economides, a professor of economics at new york university and an expert witness for the plaintiffs in the moehrl case, found that in those three markets, only about % to % of homebuyers used agents compared to % in the us. the buyers who did use agents typically paid % to % in commissions, compared to the % to % that's common here. sellers, meanwhile, paid % to %, compared to the % to % in the us. there have been other legal challenges to the current commission arrangement, including an antitrust investigation against the nar by the trump administration that led to a settlement — but the system so far has remained largely intact. \"we will continue to fight these cases because the model that we are currently working with, first of all, has improved, iterated, and innovated over the last years,\" johnson said. \"it will continue to innovate. but it has always been lawful and serves the best interests of consumers.\"depending on whom you ask, the pending lawsuits could either revolutionize or ruin the real estate industry. but despite the billions of dollars at stake, the legal fights have mostly amounted to background noise — at least so far.\"everyone's not really paying that much attention,\" rob hahn, a longtime consultant to local mlss and realtor associations, told me. \"i think agents and brokers just figure, 'we'll solve this somehow.'\"that may end up being true, but the stakes for every person in the real estate industry are incredibly high. the sheer size of the damages sought by the plaintiffs would undoubtedly wreak havoc on the industry's largest players. but for regular agents, there would also be a reckoning. if buyers have to pay out of pocket for their agents, many might choose to not hire an agent at all, or just pay an agent by the hour for their insight. agents would face more competition for clients and potentially depressed commissions. the current glut of agents would become more glaring, and a mass exodus from the industry could ensue. the nar argues that this would be a calamity for first time and low income buyers who don't have the cash on hand to pay an agent upfront, and would therefore risk being deprived of that expertise. brobeck, of the cfa, told me he believes the industry would be highly incentivized to find ways to allow buyers to obtain financing for their broker's fees, the way they already finance their home. in some cases, sellers could still agree to pay the buyer agent's commissions. and because of the increased attention on commissions, both buyers and sellers would be more likely to negotiate those costs down, brobeck said. \"i think the most successful, experienced, and competent agents will continue to be able to charge what they're charging now,\" brobeck told me. \"but the many agents who are inexperienced, less competent, less successful, will not be able to charge the going rate.\"if the typical total commissions for a real estate sale were to fall to between % and %, instead of the customary % to % today, brobeck estimates the potential savings for consumers could reach $ billion to $ billion a year.but a victory for the plaintiffs is far from guaranteed, some experts say. since the nar doesn't mandate that brokers representing the seller promise a specific amount to their buyer agent counterparts, the plaintiffs will have to prove that requiring any compensation at all hurts sellers, david eisenstadt, a managing director at berkeley research group and a former senior economist at the justice department's antitrust division, told me. the defendants could then argue something like this: if a seller is able to offer a commission of as little as $ , that's basically the same as offering zero dollars, so that requirement really isn't that onerous at all. the defense could also argue that sellers should pay the buyer agent's commission because they actually benefit the most from their service, eisenstadt said — namely, bringing forth a buyer who's willing to shell out hundreds of thousands of dollars for their home. \"there are really strong efficiency reasons for sellers to pay the buyer broker commission at settlement, rather than the buyer,\" eisenstadt said. on the other hand, hahn, who now runs a startup focused on bringing the auction model to residential real estate, told me he's doubtful of nar's chances of winning in court and believes some kind of settlement is likely. with the smaller of the two suits slated for trial in just a few months, the industry has little time to come to grips with what the future could hold. \"this is a real, serious threat,\" hahn said. \"this is not a joke.\"james rodriguez is a senior reporter on insider's discourse team. \n",

      "tesla ceo elon musk has dropped the prices of tesla models six times since the start of the year, kicking off tesla price wars with mainstream car brands like ford and gm. here's a look at where the pricing stands for each of the models. the tesla model is the cheapest model. the starting price for the tesla model is around $ , for the real wheel drive, $ , for the long range variant, and $ , for the performance variant.the next cheapest model is the tesla model y. the starting price for the tesla model y is around $ , for the all wheel drive and $ , for the performance model. in early , extensive tesla markdowns on the prices of the model and model y hit the market, making some cost less than the average new car in the us. tesla model s and the model x are the most expensive models. the tesla model s is around $ , for the long range variant and $ , for the plaid variant.the starting price for the tesla model x: the starting price for the tesla model x is around $ , and $ , for the plaid variant.the tesla roaster is expected to be the most expensive model when it enters production, at a base price of around $ , . as part of the inflation reduction act, some tesla models are eligible for a $ , ev tax credit, while others can receive a smaller credit of $ , . as of june, three model y variants were eligible for full credit while only the performance version of the model can receive the full $ , credit. the two other model versions are eligible for half credit. a big concern for prospective ev buyers is if the battery will need replacing. ev battery replacements could cost anywhere from $ , to $ , , according to recurrent.in tesla's impact report, it said that the company's battery packs are designed to outlast the vehicle. \"we estimate that a vehicle gets scrapped after approximately , miles of usage in the u.s. and roughly , miles in europe,\" the report said. tesla's batteries are also covered by a warranty. models have slightly different warranties, but they're generally covered for years or between , , miles (whatever comes first). while evs as a category do have more frequent problems than other vehicles such as issues with battery packs and charging, tesla models stand out for their reliability. no, tesla charging isn't free, and the cost varies based on if you charge at home or at one of tesla's proprietary superchargers. at a supercharger, charging costs vary based on the speed across four tiers and are based on time — not range or energy added to your vehicle. charges will also change based on electricity costs. on average, a tesla will charge for about . cents per mile, according to energysage estimates, depending on local electricity costs. a full charge on a level charger will run you about $ . on average, the site says, though costs vary for each model. the cost of charging a tesla is more than times cheaper per mile than the cost of fueling a gas powered car.energysage estimates that it costs $ . to charge your tesla per year. in comparison, gas powered cars cost an average of $ , . to fuel per year.tesla superchargers also charge an \"idle fee\" if a car remains plugged in after it is fully charged, in order to serve more customers efficiently. some tesla vehicles also include free charging, which is sometimes added as an incentive when purchasing. free charging is also available through tesla's referral program. to get the cheapest charging, you'll need to charge at home. if you already have a volt outlet in your garage (equivalent to level ), you can simply buy a charger and plug it in. otherwise, an electrician will likely need to install one for you. here's what to know about charging teslas at home. \n",

      "kgosientsho ramokgopa, south africa's newly minted electricity minister, followed up a trip to china last week with pronouncements that the communist party will provide a solution for the socialist country's collapsing power grid, which has needed planned blackouts for much of the past year.\n",
      "south africa, ruled by the radical leftist african national congress (anc) since the end of apartheid, has seen its electric infrastructure slowly deteriorate as a result of socialist mismanagement and corruption for the past three decades, resulting in the current situation.\n",
      "the government of president cyril ramaphosa, through the state run power company eskom, declared a \"national state of disaster\" in february regarding the lack of power generation and has imposed rolling blackout schedules for the vast majority of the population, branded under the euphemism \"load shedding.\"\n",
      "the blackouts have been so severe that south africa has reduced its carbon emissions to such a level that it is one of the world's few countries to be exceeding onerous, climate change related emissions reduction goals.\n",
      "the anc has offered few solutions for the ongoing power crisis, which disproportionately affects poor south africans as the wealthy have begun depending on private generators. the pivot to china arrives in the context of many other african nations also welcoming chinese investment to the continent, often with disastrous results.\n",
      "under the chinese belt and road initiative (bri), the communist party has taken up infrastructure projects in ethiopia, kenya, rwanda, tanzania, zimbabwe, and many other african nations. the presence of chinese officials and business leaders has led to mounting reports of racism against locals, including cases of chinese businessmen whipping rwandan laborers, gang beating kenyan engineers, and forcing malawian children to film racist videos for the amusement of chinese social media users in which they refer to themselves unknowingly, in mandarin, as \"black monsters.\"\n",
      "south africa joined the belt and road initiative in . china is south africa's top trade partner.\n",
      "despite this, ramokgopa has teased a \"major grant\" of chinese money to restore the south african power grid and celebrated shanghai electric and the controversial tech company huawei as potentially valuable partners, voice of america reported this week. from beijing, ramokgopa claimed that he was working to build a \"lasting partnership\" in \"energy security\" with china. he described much of the partnership to focus on replacing fossil fuels with solar panels and other questionable \"green\" energy generation.\n",

      "we just saw the latest impact from the supreme court's recent surprise ruling on the voting rights act — the surprise being that the court sided with voting rights in that alabama case. after that june ruling in allen v. milligan, the court on monday dismissed a similar voting rights act appeal from louisiana — with the upshot being that a fairer congressional map may be used in louisiana ahead of the elections. more broadly, the milligan case puts democrats in a better position to win the house of representatives. in milligan, a bare majority of the supreme court upheld a crucial part of the voting rights act, the landmark civil rights law that the court had previously gutted another part of in shelby county v. holder. given the court's opposition to voting rights over the years, including in shelby county, a similar ruling was expected in the alabama case. but in a vote, the court said the alabama map in question diluted black voting power. the ruling paved the way for fairer maps not only in alabama but in other states, such as louisiana — specifically, it carved a path for adding a second \"majority minority\" district, creating the possibility of more equal representation relative to the state's population. to be sure, the supreme court already did damage on this front, by allowing these apparently illegal maps in the midterms, in which republicans barely won the house, before its surprise ruling in milligan. and further litigation will proceed in the louisiana case at the th u.s. circuit court of appeals, the most right wing appeals court in the country. so we will see how the th circuit handles the case going forward. but with milligan as precedent, it will be more difficult for right wing courts to dismantle voting rights. subscribe to the deadline: legal blog newsletter for weekly updates on the top legal stories, including news from the supreme court, the donald trump investigations and more. \n",

      "Title: Lawsuit against ChatGPT creator shows the creepiness of AI\n",
      "this was bound to happen. openai, the tech company responsible for developing the artificial intelligence chatbot known as chatgpt, is being sued over its practice of scraping other people's information from the internet in order to provide users of the tool with seemingly human responses. microsoft, a major investor in openai, is also named as a defendant. openai and microsoft do not appear to have publicly commented on the lawsuit. the class action lawsuit strikes at the heart of generative ai tools that appear to create content from \"scratch,\" like chatgpt. in reality, such chatbots are built to scour the internet (including social media platforms) to inform their responses. for those who aren't techies, think of chatbots like a super powered internet search. while you historically would type in a term and then receive a list of links, chatbot responses rapidly search the internet for content that's already been created, as well as other information that may exist on the web, and synthesize the findings into a human sounding response. the lawsuit claims openai engages in theft when its technology does this: (note: openai isn't the only company creating generative ai tools, though it's arguably the most popular. hence the \"arms race\" line in the quote above.) the lawsuit accuses openai of scraping data belonging to millions of users, including online conversations, location data and other personal information that the company is able to obtain through third party applications. the suit lists spotify, stripe, slack, snapchat, microsoft teams and the health app mychart as some of the third parties that allow openai access to user data. openai secretly harvests \"massive amounts of personal data from the internet,\" the suit claims, \"including private information and private conversations, medical data, information about children—essentially every piece of data exchanged on the internet it could take—without notice to the owners or users of such data, much less with anyone's permission.\" the lawsuit doesn't list the plaintiffs' names beyond initials — in order to \"avoid intrusive scrutiny as well as any potentially dangerous backlash\" — but it does offer details about their claims. some of the plaintiffs say they're worried that their online content could be used to help replace human workers with robots. for example, the lawsuit says one educator is \"concerned that defendants have taken her skills and expertise, as reflected in her online contributions, and incorporated it into products that could someday result in professional obsolescence for professors and educators like her.\" the suit also claims that without \"this unprecedented theft of private and copyrighted information belonging to real people, communicated to unique communities, for specific purposes, targeting specific audiences, the products would not be the multi billion dollar business they are today.\" it's no overstatement to say this lawsuit could slow — if not completely alter — the fast moving world of generative ai. visual artists whose works have been scraped by ai tools have already filed at least one class action suit of their own, claiming this amounts to copyright infringement. several musicians have spoken out against the use of generative ai in their industry as well. but professional artists and creators clearly aren't the only ones with skin in the game here, as the latest lawsuit suggests. everyone who uses the internet should be invested in making sure our data isn't being used — to great profit and potential peril — by some of the most powerful tech companies in the world.  \n",

      "Title: Supreme Court strikes down Biden student loan relief plan\n",
      "the supreme court on friday struck down the biden administration's student loan forgiveness plan that would have canceled billions of dollars of debt for millions of americans. chief justice john roberts wrote the decision, claiming the federal government lacked authority for the plan. but as justice elena kagan pointed out in her dissent, it was the majority, not the government, that overreached here. \"in every respect, the court today exceeds its proper, limited role in our nation's governance,\" she wrote, joined by her fellow democratic appointees, justices sonia sotomayor and ketanji brown jackson. apparently anticipating this outcome, the white house on friday signaled \"new actions\" coming to protect student loan borrowers. in announcing the plan last august, the white house aimed to reduce \"a significant burden on america's middle class\" by easing the \"crushing\" effects of student loans. the plan applied to people whose annual income was less than $ , ($ , for households) in either or , providing up to $ , for most borrowers and up to $ , for pell grant recipients with greater financial need. during oral arguments in february, the republican appointees were skeptical of the government's power to forgive that much debt. the court's democratic appointees were skeptical that the challengers — republican led states and individual borrowers — even had legal standing to challenge debt relief in the first place. jackson at the time noted that the court would break new ground by finding standing here. (in a related case on friday, department of education v. brown, involving individual borrowers, the court unanimously agreed the challengers didn't have legal standing to bring the claim. but the plan was struck down by the decision roberts authored, involving the states' challenge, biden v. nebraska.) the law at issue is the heroes act. it lets the secretary of education \"waive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision\" to protect borrowers affected by national emergencies, among other things. the biden administration pointed to the covid pandemic as the emergency allowing debt forgiveness. the administration wrote to the justices ahead of the arguments that \"the acute public health emergency caused by covid is abating\" but \"the heroes act and the secretary's plan are not aimed at stopping the spread of disease; they are concerned with economic consequences.\" but the court majority's complaint, essentially, was that the government went too big. \"the secretary has never previously claimed powers of this magnitude under the heroes act,\" roberts wrote, with seeming amazement at how different circumstances call for different responses, adding that \"past waivers and modifications issued under the act have been extremely modest and narrow in scope.\" obviously, though, covid didn't happen before it happened. pointing out this plain fact, kagan observed, \"past actions were more modest because the precipitating emergencies were more modest.\" she faulted the majority for deciding \"that some million americans will not receive the benefits the plan provides, because (so says the court) that assistance is too 'significan[t].'\" and the court shouldn't have found standing in this case either, kagan argued. \"the court's first overreach in this case is deciding it at all,\" she wrote. she called the states \"classic ideological plaintiffs: they think the plan a very bad idea, but they are no worse off because the secretary differs.\" \"a court acting like a court,\" kagan wrote, would have tossed the case on standing grounds. her critique was apparently too much for the victors to handle, as roberts felt the need to chastise it as he closed his opinion. \"it has become a disturbing feature of some recent opinions to criticize the decisions with which they disagree as going beyond the proper role of the judiciary,\" the chief justice wrote, tone policing the losing side of the dispute. \"we do not mistake this plainly heartfelt disagreement for disparagement,\" roberts assured the nation, adding that it's \"important that the public not be misled either. any such misperception would be harmful to this institution and our country.\" but who cares if the justices are disparaging one another? the harm to the institution is coming from court actions like friday's rulings, not by the justices using strong language in their opinions. thus, keeping in line with his ruling's reasoning, roberts ended the opinion, and the term, by going beyond his proper role. read the full text of the opinion striking down biden's student loan forgiveness plan below. subscribe to the deadline: legal blog newsletter for weekly updates on the top legal stories, including news from the supreme court, the donald trump investigations and more. \n",

      "Title: McCarthy finds new ways to tell far-right flank what it wants to hear\n",
      "the very idea of congress un impeaching someone seems laughable. that doesn't mean house republicans won't try to do it anyway. as we discussed last week, two prominent gop members — house republican conference chair elise stefanik of new york and georgia's marjorie taylor greene — unveiled a pair of measures to \"expunge\" both of donald trump's impeachments. (greene's resolution would effectively cancel the former president's impeachment, while stefanik's measure would undo his impeachment. both republicans are co sponsoring each other's bills.) to be sure, ridiculous measures such as these are introduced all the time, and they're fairly easy to ignore because they stand little chance of advancing. but as the associated press reported, the \"expunge\" scheme picked up a powerful endorsement the day after it began in earnest. \"i think it is appropriate,\" the house speaker told reporters. \"just as i thought before — that you should expunge it, because it never should have gone through.\" to briefly recap for those just joining us, it was in early , just two days after his first senate impeachment trial wrapped up, when trump first broached the subject of invalidating what had happened to him. \"should they expunge the impeachment in the house?\" trump asked during a brief q&a with reporters. \"they should because it was a hoax.\" a handful of gop members pushed the idea in the last congress, though the efforts were ignored — there was a democratic majority in the house at the time — but as the current congress got underway, mccarthy said he was willing to take a look at the idea. evidently, the house speaker is done looking, and he's ready to throw his support behind the gambit. (as for how such an unprecedented procedure would work, my msnbc colleague hayes brown wrote a terrific piece on this that ran this morning.) what's more, this isn't the only step mccarthy is willing to take to make his far right flank happy. punchbowl news reported: as part of the push, the house speaker has effectively directed house judiciary committee chairman jim jordan to bring david weiss, the trump appointed u.s. attorney who investigated hunter biden, before the panel. as for what far right house republicans might consider \"satisfactory answers,\" it's hardly outlandish to wonder if there's anything that could fully satisfy gop members desperate to impeach someone for something. what's less clear is what's driving mccarthy's latest declarations. in the recent past, the california republican was opposed to impeachment crusades and didn't seem at all interested in pursing a trump based legislative agenda. now, the house speaker has raised the prospect of impeaching multiple cabinet secretaries, and he's on board with trying to un impeach the former president. we've never received a full and detailed list of the private side deals mccarthy struck in january to get his speaker's gavel, or the more recent agreements he reached after the house freedom caucus seized control of the house floor. it's hard not to wonder: is mccarthy backing outlandish ideas because he genuinely believes they're worthwhile, or is he still repaying debts to his more radical members? \n",

      "there's been a shake up in the prosecution of protesters who have demonstrated against plans for a massive new police compound in atlanta that critics have dubbed \"cop city.\" and the news is raising questions about politicized law enforcement in georgia. more than people are facing domestic terrorism charges in connection with protests in recent months, according to the associated press. on friday, the district attorney of dekalb county, sherry boston, announced that she'll no longer take part in their prosecutions, which will now be overseen by georgia's republican attorney general, chris carr. the statement from the dekalb da's office said: the announcement followed a report from the intercept last week that the georgia ag had denied boston's request to drop domestic terrorism charges against a southern poverty law center legal observer who was arrested at the construction site in march. critics of \"cop city,\" including many faith leaders, oppose the acre facility because it requires destroying part of a forest and they worry that it would contribute to overpolicing in dekalb, a majority black county. one protester, known as tortuguita, was fatally shot by police in january. the dekalb district attorney's withdrawal from the prosecutions was celebrated by activists. in a statement, the naacp legal defense fund's associate director counsel, tona boyd, called it a \"welcome development\" but added that it \"also deepens our serious concern about whether these arrests have been motivated by something other than an impartial and objective evaluation of the evidence or a just exercise of prosecutorial discretion.\" indeed, this development is colored by troubling events at the state level. in recent months, georgia republicans have taken steps to usurp power from liberal district attorneys and circumvent their wishes. these moves, including legislation that makes it easier to oust das from their posts, are part of an effort to cast liberal das as soft on crime. as the naacp ldf said, it's good news that the dekalb da is no longer engaging in this tough on crime charade when it comes to the \"cop city\" cases. but the republican ag still will be — and that's deeply concerning.  \n",

      "\"i always went above and beyond for the old money people, trying to find them what they were looking for, because they were just so nice about it. they'd say things like, 'it's okay, really,' and i'd say, 'nope, it says we have one in stock somewhere. i'm going to find it and have it sent to you.' i'd be determined and on a mission.

      "\"i've watched them slip a dime or quarter into the collection plate at their church and attend black tie charity events without paying for their plate or providing any donation (they're all generous volunteering their time). they never speak of money and denigrate displays of wealth. ultimately, i think it's the individual person and not their socioeconomic class that primarily dictates behavior, but from what i've witnessed firsthand, old money is synonymous with excessive penny pinching.\"—drlc\n",

      "\"secondly, many of the new money owners got their money in a short span of time and at a very young age with the urge to spend on the things they dreamed about. in contrast, the old money owners got money with hard work and savings at a much later stage in life, when they are mentally balanced with limited demands and no urge to spend money except for the well being of society.\"—bharatsgr \n",

      "\"new money may find themselves uncomfortable in these types of hierarchical situations; the discomfort comes out as arrogance. it's annoying and hard to justify a superior worth when you know deep down, it isn't really justifiable to that degree. they are also probably busier, stressed, and preoccupied with managing their wealth — they know what there is to lose. old money has no clue of what life is without all the access, possessions, and power. both unfortunately tend to forget their money comes from somewhere, and that's probably someone else or someone else's resources and luck historically. with great wealth comes great power, and no one individual has the capacity to own up to the wealth that today's disparity has created. humans messed up big time.\"—tamarabavdek\n",

      "\"new money would not have seen generations of having staff and treating staff as kindly as, say, a friendly neighbor. also, old money fears one thing: a bad reputation. one sure way to kill loyalty and discretion is to be rude and abusive, so i guess there's always been some self serving motivation in there, too. happy help doesn't gossip. i certainly wouldn't.\"—chrisallen \n",

      "firstly, congratulations on stepping into one of the world's biggest franchises! did you have any nerves about joining a universe that's already so established?kingsley: no more than what i normally experience before any job really. it just felt like a new job and a new character and, you know, what comes with all of that.this franchise comes with such a dedicated fanbase, and is packed full of fan theories. have you heard about any theories to do with your character yet?kingsley: no, not at all! i haven't seen or heard anything. i'm sure it's all to come when the show lands, but not since filming, no. marvel has this huge fan base, which i'm becoming more aware of as time goes on. as of right now, i haven't had any interactions with anyone yet.\n",
      " marvel\n",
      "in the projects i've seen you in recently, you've either been american or you've had a different accent. do you find it more comfortable using a british accent and being surrounded by british cast mates?kingsley: i'll be honest with you, there was a part of me that didn't want to lend any of myself to this role. i remember chatting with producers at the beginning and saying to them, \"where can we place him?\" in an early iteration of the story, there were details about him being an ex soldier, and him being mixed race was also an important part of the story at one stage.we were looking at different places he could be from – obviously birmingham had been done, peaky blinders did it, so that didn't work. there's a mixed race community in butetown just outside of cardiff, and i just thought that might be a nice way in. it's a large caribbean community with a military history too, so i started speaking to people from around there to figure out the character.i think producers were kind of against it at the beginning – they just thought... welsh??? there was a sort of resistance to it, and i was like, \"guys, you're not even gonna notice the difference between my accent and the way i'm going to do this.\" it's really subtle – it wasn't like the valleys because it's closer to the british border.\n",

      "Title: It’s Time to End the Tyranny of Ultra-Processed Food\n",
      "this type of food is usually wrapped in plastic and has additives that you won't find in a typical kitchen. in the us and the uk, we get on average percent of our calories from upf products like pizza, bread, breakfast cereals, biscuits, and nutritional drinks. they're often sold as healthy options, but it's just a way of turning our ill health into money. upf is a byproduct of a complicated financial system that involves repurposing waste from animal food into human food.\n",
      "to solve this problem, the first thing we need to do is include in the official uk guidance about nutrition the information that ultra processed foods are associated with weight gain and diet related diseases, and that the recommendation for people is to avoid these foods. many countries like brazil and france already do this.\n",
      "limiting the marketing of ultra processed foods is essential. we need to learn the lessons from regulating the tobacco industry and stop predatory companies selling this food to people.\n",
      "we also need to change the ultra processed institutional food that we serve in hospitals, schools, and prisons. there is very good evidence that when feeding patients and staff in hospitals, real food is hugely beneficial.\n",
      "there are also misconceptions we need to address. for instance, people who live with diet related diseases, especially obesity, usually have a strong feeling of guilt, thinking they are the problem due to their own lack of willpower. researchers now know this isn't true. this food has been engineered to be addictive. we need to shift the blame away from the population.\n",
      "normally, we would blame the food companies and demand change from them. but when you speak to people in any of those companies it's very clear that they are unable to change. danone is the best example of this. its previous ceo, emmanuel faber, tried to turn the company into a social enterprise by stopping the sale of ultra processed food and increasing the environmental portfolio. the share price tanked, activist investors threw him out, and danone had no option but to go back to its previous business model. all the big transnational food corporations are answerable to their owners. if we don't understand this financial loop, we will keep shouting at companies that cannot change their business model. what we have to understand is that the responsibility lies with governments. they need a mandate from their population to change the regulations.\n",
      "another group of people whom we don't criticize enough are the doctors, who have a very long history of partnering with transnational food corporations and supplement providers to mislead people. most nutrition research is funded by the food industry and that's clearly wrong.\n",
      "anyone who's struggling with this as an individual should take their guilt and shame and transfer it outwardly to the corporations that are feeding us these addictive substances, to the governments doing nothing about it, and to the physicians and the social media personalities who keep telling us that this stuff is healthy. we need to end the conflict of interest between the industry and politicians, doctors and scientists. only then can we really tackle the problem.\n",

      "Author(s): Maryn McKenna\n",
      "Title: States With Abortion Bans Are Losing a Generation of Ob-Gyns\n",
      "fishbach was in michigan, where an abortion ban enacted in instantly came into effect. that law made administering an abortion a felony punishable by four years in prison, with no exceptions for rape or incest. it was a chilling moment: her residency is in obstetrics and gynecology, and she viewed mastering abortion procedures as essential to her training.\n",
      "\"i suspected during my application cycle that this could happen, and to receive confirmation of it was devastating,\" she recalls. \"but i had strategically applied where i thought that, even if i didn't receive the full spectrum, i would at least have the support and the resources to get myself to an institution that would train me.\"\n",
      "her mind whirled through the possibilities. would her program help its residents go to an access protecting state? could she broker an agreement to go somewhere on her own, arranging weeks of extra housing and obtaining a local medical license and insurance? would she still earn her salary if she left her program—and how would she fund her life if she did not?\n",
      "in the end, she didn't need to leave. that november, michigan voters approved an amendment to the state constitution that made the law unenforceable, and this april, governor gretchen whitmer repealed the ban. fishbach didn't have to abandon the state to learn the full range of ob gyn care. in fact, her program at the university of michigan, where she's now a second year resident, pivoted to making room for red state trainees.\n",
      "but the dizzying reassessment she underwent a year ago provides a glimpse of the challenges that face thousands of new and potential doctors. almost percent of the accredited ob gyn programs in the us now operate under revived or new abortion bans, meaning that more than , residents per year—trainee doctors who have committed to the specialty—may not receive the required training to be licensed. among students and residents, simmering anger over bans is growing. long time faculty fear the result will be a permanent reshaping of american medicine, driving new doctors from red states to escape limitations and legal threats, or to protect their own reproductive options. that would reduce the number of physicians available, not just to provide abortions, but to conduct genetic screenings, care for miscarriages, deliver babies, and handle unpredictable pregnancy risks.\n",
      "\"i worry that we're going to see an increase in maternal morbidity, differentially, depending on where you live,\" says kate shaw, a physician and associate chair of ob gyn education at stanford medicine. \"and that's just going to further enhance disparities that already exist.\"\n",
      "those effects are not yet visible. the pipeline that ushers medical graduates through physician training is about a decade long: four years of school plus three to seven years of residency, sometimes with a two year, sub specialty fellowship afterward. thus actions taken in response to the dobbs decision—people eschewing red state schools or choosing to settle in blue states long term—might take a while to be noticeable.\n",
      "but in this year, some data has emerged that suggests trends to come. in february, a group of students, residents and faculty surveyed , licensed and trainee physicians and found that percent want to work or train in states that retain abortion access—and percent would refuse to apply in states that restrict it. (the respondents worked in a mix of specialties; for those whose work would include performing abortions, the proportion intending to work where it remains legal soared above percent.)\n",
      "then in april, a study from the association of american medical colleges drawing on the first round of applications to residency programs after dobbs found that ob gyn applications in states with abortion restrictions sank by percent compared to the previous year. applications to all ob gyn programs dropped by percent. (nationwide, all applications to residency went down percent from to .)\n",
      "last month, two preliminary pieces of research presented at the annual meeting of the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists uncovered more perturbations. in texas—where the restrictive law sb went into effect in september , nine months before dobbs—a multi year upward trend in applications to ob gyn residency slowed after the law passed. and in an unrelated national survey, percent of thirdand fourth year medical students said that abortion restrictions would affect where they applied to residency, while percent said they were unlikely to apply to states with a ban.\n",
      "that last survey was conducted by ariana traub and kellen \"nell\" mermin bunnell, two third year medical students at emory university school of medicine in atlanta—which lies within a state with a \"fetal heartbeat\" law that predates dobbs and that criminalizes providing an abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. the law means that students in clinical rotations are unlikely to witness abortions and would not be allowed to discuss the procedure with patients. it also means that, if either of them were to become pregnant while at med school, they would not have that option themselves.\n",
      "before they published the survey, the two friends conducted an analysis of how bans would affect medical school curricula, using data collected in the summer of . they predicted that only percent of the more than , medical students in the us would not be affected by state bans. the survey gave them a chance to sample med students' feelings about those developments, with the help of faculty members. they also founded a nonprofit, georgia healthcare professionals for reproductive justice. \"we're in a unique position, as individuals in the health care field but not necessarily medical professionals yet,\" traub says. \"we have some freedom. so we felt like we had to use that power to try to make change.\"\n",
      "the conflict between what medicine demands and state laws prevent leaves new and would be doctors in restrictive states struggling with their inability to follow medical evidence and their own best intentions. \"i'm starting to take care of patients for the first time in my life,\" says mermin bunnell, traub's survey partner. \"seeing a human being in front of you, who needs your help, and not being able to help them or even talk to them about what their options might be—it feels morally wrong.\"\n",
      "that frustration is equally evident among trainees in specialties who might treat a pregnant person, prescribe treatments that could imperil a pregnancy, or care for a pregnancy gone wrong. those include family and adolescent medicine, anesthesiology, radiology, rheumatology, even dermatology and mental health.\n",
      "\"i'm particularly interested in oncology, and i've come to realize that you can't have the full standard of gynecologic oncology care without being able to have access to abortion care,\" says morgan levy, a fourth year medical student in florida who plans to apply to ob gyn residency. florida currently bans abortion after weeks; a further ban, down to six weeks, passed in april but has been held up by legal challenges. in three years of med school so far, levy received one lecture on abortion—in the context of miscarriage—and no clinical exposure to the procedure. \"it is a priority for me to make sure that i get trained,\" she says.\n",
      "but landing in a training program that encourages abortion practice is more difficult than it looks. residency application is an algorithm driven process in which graduates list their preferred programs, and faculty rank the trainees they want to teach. for years, there have been more applicants than there are spaces—and this year, as in the past, ob gyn programs filled almost all their slots. what that means, according to faculty members, is that some applicants will end up where they do not want to be.\n",
      "\"students and trainees do exert their preferences, but they also need to get a training spot,\" says vineet arora, the dean for medical education at the university of chicago pritzker school of medicine and lead author on the survey published in february. \"would they forgo a training spot because of dobbs? that's a tall order, especially in a competitive field. but would they be happy about it? and would they want to stay there long term?\"\n",
      "that is not a hypothetical question. according to the medical colleges association, more than half of residents stay to practice in the states where they trained. but it's reasonable to ask whether they would feel that loyalty if they were deprived of training or forced to relocate. \"if even a portion of the percent of people who prefer to practice and train in states that don't have abortion bans follow through on those preferences, those states that are putting in abortion bans—which often have workforce shortages already—will be in a worse situation,\" arora says.\n",
      "an acog analysis estimated in that half of us counties, which are home to million women, have no practicing ob gyn. when the health care tech firm doximity examined ob gyn workloads in , seven of the cities it identified as having the highest workloads lie in what are now very restrictive states. those shortages are likely to worsen if new doctors relocate to states where they feel safe. the legal and consulting firm manatt health predicted in a white paper last fall: \"the impact on access to all ob/gyn care in certain geographies could be catastrophic.\"\n",
      "steinauer directs the kenneth j. ryan residency training program, a year old effort to install and reinforce clinical abortion training. even before dobbs, that was hard to come by: in , steinauer and colleagues estimated that only two thirds of ob gyn residency programs made it routine, despite accreditation requirements—and that anywhere from to percent of residents couldn't competently perform different types of abortion when they left training. in , researchers from ucsf and uc berkeley documented that percent of these programs face limitations set by individual hospitals more extreme than those set by states.\n",
      "before dobbs, the ryan program brokered individual relocations that let trainees temporarily transfer to other institutions. now it is working to set up program to program agreements instead, because the logistics required to visit for a rotation—the kind of arrangements fishbach dizzily imagined a year ago—are more complex than most people can manage on their own. and not only on the visiting trainee: programs already perform delicate calculations of how many trainees they can take given the number of patients coming to their institutions and the number of faculty mentors.\n",
      "only a few places have managed to institutionalize \"away rotations,\" in which they align accreditation milestones, training time, and financing with other institutions. oregon health & science university's school of medicine is about to open a formal program that will accept to residents from restrictive states for a month each over a year. oregon imposes no restrictions on abortion, and both the med school's existing residents and the university's philanthropic foundation supported the move.\n",
      "\"i'm very concerned about having a future generation that knows how to provide safe abortion care—because abortion will never go away; becoming illegal only makes it less safe,\" says alyssa colwill, who oversees the new program and is an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology. \"there are going to be patients that are going to use unsafe methods because there's no other alternative. and providers are going to be placed in scenarios that are heartbreaking, and are devastating to watch.\"\n",
      "this isn't imaginary: already, research has shown that physicians practicing in red states are less likely to offer appropriate and legal procedures to treat miscarriages. receiving abortion training, in other words, also improves medical care for pregnancy loss.\n",
      "\"ultimately, i do not think there is capacity to train every resident who wants training,\" says charisse loder, a clinical assistant professor of ob gyn at the university of michigan medical school, who directs the program where fishbach is training. \"so we will have ob gyn residents who are not trained in this care. and i think that is not only unfortunate, but puts patients in a position of being cared for by residents who don't have comprehensive training.\"\n",
      "doing only short rotations also returns residents to places where their own reproductive health could be put at risk. future physicians are likely to be older than in previous generations, having been encouraged to get life experience and sample other careers before entering med school. research on which levy and arora collaborated in shows that more than percent of new physicians had abortions during their training. because of the length of training, they also may be more likely to use ivf when they are ready to start families—and some reproductive technologies may be criminalized under current abortion bans.\n",
      "as a fourth and final year psychiatry resident, simone bernstein had thought about abortion restrictions through the lens of her patients' mental health, as she talked to them about fertility treatment and pregnancy loss. as cofounder of the online platform inside the match, she had listened to residents' reactions to dobbs (and collaborated on research with levy and arora). she had not expected the decision to affect her personally—but she is in missouri, a state where there is an almost complete ban on abortion. and this spring, she experienced a miscarriage at weeks of pregnancy.\n",
      "\"i was worried whether or not i could even go to the hospital, if my baby still had a heartbeat, which was a conversation that i had to have with my ob gyn on the phone,\" she says. \"it didn't come to that; i caught the baby in my hands at home, hemorrhaging blood everywhere, and the baby had already passed away. but until that moment, i didn't recognize the effects that [abortion restrictions] could have on me.\"\n",
      "this is the reality now: there exist very few places in the us where abortion is uncomplicated. faculty and their trainees do not expect that to change, except for the worse. staying in the field, and making sure the next generation is prepared, requires commitment that they will have to sustain for years.\n",
      "\"part of the reason why i sought advanced training in abortion and contraception is because i think there will be a national ban,\" says abigail liberty, an ob gyn and fellow in her sixth postgraduate year at ohsu. \"i think it will happen in our lifetime. and i see my role as getting as much expertise and training as i can now and providing care while i can. and then coming out of retirement, when abortion will be legal again, and training the next generation of physicians.\" \n",

      "Author(s): Elissaveta M. Brandon\n",
      "Title: Ryuichi Sakamoto’s Final Performance Is a Virtual-Only Engagement\n",
      "the performance lasts about minutes. the oscar winning composer plays of his own compositions, and at the end of every piece, people clap. not me at first, but i make up for it with tears, which first build up in my throat, then stream down my cheeks. when it's over, sakamoto doesn't bow and walk off the stage; he passed away in march this year after a years long battle with cancer. he just fades into black as i take off the headset i am wearing.\n",
      "kagami, as the music performance is called, is a mixed reality show on view through july at the shed in manhattan and at factory international in manchester, with runs at the sydney opera house and the big ears festival in knoxville, tennessee, up next. the show begins with people sitting in a circle around absolutely nothing. after each concertgoer has slid on a magic leap headset, a virtual sakamoto appears in the center of the circle. the musician then performs as you mosey \"around\" him, being ever so careful not to bump into a piano that doesn't exist—or your fellow attendees, who do.\n",
      "kagami—japanese for \"mirror\"—was designed by the production studio tin drum, and fuses a d model of sakamoto with the real world, resulting in an experience that feels material and ethereal at once. it is part of an ever growing cohort of musical experimentations with ar and vr. in the thick of the pandemic in , billie eilish performed a livestreamed concert jazzed up with extended reality effects that turned the stage into a gloomy ocean floor and a star studded sky. in , gorillaz took over new york's times square, then london's piccadilly circus, as ar technology brought the band's characters to life on giant screens. the list goes on to include ariana grande, justin bieber, and travis scott, most of whom started to dabble with mixed reality during the pandemic.\n",
      "fast forward to november , and both men flew from new york city, where they were based, to locked down tokyo, one of only two cities in the world with the setup necessary to capture sakamoto in d and generate a virtual model of him using volumetric and motion capture technology. the session lasted three days, during which sakamoto played his compositions under the scrutiny of cameras, various microphones, and lightboxes.\n",
      "there was nothing glamorous about it: every surface around him, piano included, was covered in green—\"kermit land,\" jokes eckert. sakamoto was wearing lentil sized motion capture markers on his face, with almost of them strategically taped to the back of his hands. his thin silver hair, which normally falls over his forehead, was waxed back and held under a net so it didn't hide his facial expressions from the cameras. \"in service of making something authentic you have to go through impossible odds and processes that seem inauthentic,\" says eckert.\n",
      "it took about six months for eckert's team to process the raw data captured in the session. in the meantime, they also had to sculpt sakamoto's hair from scratch and recreate his iconic glasses. but the most challenging thing to recreate was sakamoto's face, which was blocked from the cameras for a large part of his performance because he was hunched over.\n",
      "maybe that's because the morning before the first session started, sakamoto had learned the cancer was back, and it was everywhere. \"i didn't find out what he had found out until a year and a half later,\" says eckert, conjecturing that maybe sakamoto knew he was going to die soon, so he was leaning over the piano more than usual. \"these are the slowest versions of these songs he ever did,\" says eckert.\n",
      "because the team had inconsistent data of sakamoto's face, both in form and texture, they had to make up for the missing data by reconstructing his face using referencing segments of complete data. it took months.\n",
      "meanwhile, separate teams were working on a series of d artworks that would end up accompanying the performance: gentle fog that curls around everyone's ankles for the opening piece; a tree that draws itself on top of the piano a bit later. \"it was never my intention to simply service people who knew they loved ryuichi, but to try to expand the audience that would come to understand his work,\" says eckert. luckily, the artworks elevate the performance instead of detracting from it. while sakamoto is playing the hit track \"energy flow,\" for example, a window opens high above him, and snowflakes start floating through it. the snow effect references akira kurosawa's film ikiru, where the main character—an elderly man who knows he will die soon—spends his final moments sitting on a park swing during a snowfall, singing a romantic ballad.\n",
      "the entire show feels otherworldly, but there's only so much technology can achieve. the magic leap has a degree field of view, which is twice as big as the previous iteration, but it still means that when you look up at the ceiling to see that window, you can no longer see sakamoto. the headset is also tricky to get used to, considering you're walking around in a room full of strangers wearing the equivalent of dark sunglasses. (the magic leap comes with a dimming feature that allows real objects to slip behind virtual ones, but the illusion was so strong that people kept bumping into each other at test shows, so the team had to disable it.)\n",
      "surreal as it was, the performance left me somewhat puzzled. can a mixed reality concert ever make up for the sad reality of someone's absence? i have never seen sakamoto play live, but i doubt kagami comes close to the palpable energy of his presence in the room. what do we lose when technology becomes so integral to the most intimate of human experiences—and what do we gain?\n",
      "indre viskontas, a neuroscientist and operatic soprano who serves on the faculty at the san francisco conservatory of music, says that knowing who wrote the piece can affect how people experience it too. in , a team of researchers ran a neuroimaging study in which they asked people to lie in a scanner and listen to a piece of music that was the same for everyone. one half was told the music was composed by a human, and the other half was told it was composed by a machine. the first group, viskontas says, engaged a part of the brain that helps us understand how other people feel, think, and behave. in other words, when people knew the composer was human, they had more empathy. \"one of the things we do as humans is try to understand, 'what is that human being trying to tell me, what are their beliefs, are they friend or foe?' and we do that by essentially trying to put ourselves in the shoes of that person,\" viskontas says.\n",
      "viskontas acknowledges that the same study might yield different results if it were performed today, when our culture is steeped in ai generated music and art. it's also a bit different considering sakamoto was human, and was performing his own songs for the recording—it was just his presence that was relayed through a machine. but according to viskontas, the connection the public forms with him in mixed reality can only work if we buy into the illusion of a performer in the room, playing the piano—and if the technology is advanced enough to help us convince ourselves that it is real.\n",
      "the latter may take a while. as outlined in a study, in order for vr technology to truly make us feel like we are present in a room with a performer and an audience, it needs to better translate subtle physical changes in the performer like blushing and sweating, or almost imperceptible things like the raising of an eyebrow. it would also have to give us the option of physical contact with those around us. replicating the unique energy and atmosphere that stems from the collective presence of performers and the audience being in the venue together is another challenge. this is only partly addressed in kagami, which may be designed for a small crowd to take in together, but remains a mostly solitary experience.\n",
      "still, the show remains a captivating attempt at capturing the impossible and freezing it in time. with no room for improv, sakamoto will display the exact same emotions every single time the performance runs. will the magic fade away if i go back a second time?\n",
      "perhaps sakamoto knew the stakes. reflecting on kagami in early , shortly before his death, he wrote: \"there is, in reality, a virtual me. this virtual me will not age, and will continue to play the piano for years, decades, centuries ... will there be empathy there? empathy that spans hundreds of thousands of years. ah, but the batteries won't last that long.\" \n",

the fire max delivers what amazon is promising, which is to say it's by far the best fire tablet the company has ever made.the inch lcd screen has a nice , x , pixel resolution that's quite glare prone, but no worse than other tablets. the : format signals that the first priority here is consuming movies (and reading, if you rotate to portrait mode), but it's not great for productivity. it could be if amazon updated fire os to access some of the tools in android l, which is optimized for tablets, but fire os is based on an outdated version of android that lacks any tablet friendly features. more on that in a minute.there's a fingerprint reader on the side power button, which is a first for a fire tablet. a microsd slot lets you expand your media storage, and the keyboard now connects via pogo pins, which allow it to charge and communicate. previous fire tablets—like mine—need to connect to keyboards via bluetooth, which is inconsistent and slow on the best of days and must be charged separately. the fire max also supports wi fi and has front and rear megapixel cameras, making it better for video chats as well.under the screen sit gigabytes of ram and either a gigabyte or gigabyte ssd (the larger storage adds another $ ). the max is powered by a mediatek mt j chip, which uses an core processor. those specs put the fire max in the middle of most android tablets—more powerful than its fire siblings, but certainly not close to any oneplus or pixel tablet. for amazon though, this qualifies as a high end slate, relative to the rest of the fire lineup.amazon fire max rating: / $ at amazon$ at amazon (productivity bundle)if you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. this helps support our journalism. learn more. please also consider subscribing to wiredit's made of metal and feels much nicer than any other fire device. after using it for several weeks, i was a little sad to go back to my plasticky fire . the fire max is also noticeably faster in performance, though not enough that i would feel compelled to upgrade. one potential deal breaker is that the keyboard and case are not self supporting. to be productive with the productivity bundle, you need to put the whole thing on a flat surface.the keyboard, while usable, is on the small side. i had a lot of trouble with the trackpad, which kept clicking things when i accidentally brushed it with my palms while typing. it's not an insurmountable issue, but it's more annoying than it should be at this price. the stylus is laughably bad. luckily for users, there are almost no apps in the amazon app store that would make you want to use the stylus.prime timephotograph: amazonthe core problem with the fire max is that it's just not good enough for the money amazon is charging. if you want to use it for anything more than a firehose blasting your eyeballs with prime content, you'll have to spend $ . given that you can get a th generation ipad on amazon for roughly $ and a bluetooth keyboard for $ more, why would anyone buy a fire max ? i don't know.it's an ok tablet, but it's nowhere near as powerful as even the base model ipad, the pixel tablet, the oneplus pad, or the second generation of lenovo's tab p pro. most of these tablets cost more, yes, but they're better investments for all but the most diehard amazon fan (if such people exist).the reason you should buy something else comes down to software. fire os, amazon's proprietary fork of android, is terrible. it's always been terrible, and as far as i can tell, it will always be terrible. its sole purpose is to deliver your eyeballs to amazon. it works well for that. you'll have no trouble finding all your favorite amazon prime features and perks through fire os.if you want to do anything else, you'll find yourself fighting fire os to get it done. there are no google apps and no play store, only the limited offerings of amazon's app store. i did try to install the play store using my own instructions, but so far i have not been able to get it working. i will update that guide as soon as i figure it out, but lenovo's tab p pro is still a better investment for roughly the same price.amazon fire max rating: / $ at amazon$ at amazon (productivity bundle)if you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. this helps support our journalism. learn more. please also consider subscribing to wired$ at amazon$ at amazon (productivity bundle) \n",

      "Title: Video Game Remakes Are in a Golden Age. That Could Be a Bad Thing\n",
      "the line comes early in the game, right after our coiffured all american hero has seen his police escort burned alive. leon is about to be butchered by pitchfork and chainsaw wielding spanish farmers, but then a tolling bell suddenly psychically summons them away. the line is amazingly stupid, and if he doesn't say it, i thought after seeing news of the demo, i'm joining the mob outside the capcom offices. (reader, rest assured, the villagers attended bingo.)\n",
      "the culture industry loves a remake; it also loves a reboot, a remaster, a sequel, a prequel, a multiverse, and a cinematic universe. in a recent long read for vulture, writers josef adalian and lane brown warned that tv is headed into an era of \"safe ideas,\" comparing the times to come to the movie industry of the s. brand recognition and cultural stagnation await; harry potter and twilight series are in the works. other media also run the risk of falling into this same trap; that's the danger with sure things.\n",
      "of course, there is nothing inherently debased about remakes. no remakes, no scarface or true grit; in a broad sense, shakespeare made a career of it. it is a censorious and misguided impulse to claim that a remake undermines its subject. you might find it harder to convince someone to watch the original wicker man if they've just sat through nick cage hollering about bees (not me, that movie rocks), but in general, this logic is weird math. where there was one, now there are two. a remake is just an interpretation—it should not replace the original.\n",
      "but for video games, the math is often a subtraction. so far this year, studios have reimagined four classic games (to varying degrees of change) brilliantly: resident evil , metroid prime, dead space, and, most recently, system shock, possibly heralding a remake golden age.\n",
      "contrary to other artforms, there is a tendency in the games industry to talk about remakes as replacements. this is not to say that the history of film and literature isn't also riddled with innumerable losses, great works burned up in disasters or walled off on obscure streaming platforms. but with video games, where old versions get swapped out for the new ones on platforms like steam or the playstation store, the replacement of the original work is particularly baked into the process. and a remake is not a replacement, no matter how superior.\n",
      "in this vein, one type of remake is a simple \"remaster,\" like metroid prime, which sharpened the graphics to meet fans' nostalgia filtered memories. this kind of upgrade is often enough to impress punters: bluepoint studios beautified demon's souls to such an extent that it supposedly put pressure on the graphics team working on elden ring.\n",
      "but there are deeper ways a developer can remake a game. mark brown of the game maker's toolkit broke these down recently in a youtube video about the resident evil reboot titled \"why capcom is the king of remakes.\" the first is \"modernization,\" adding newer gameplay concepts like fast travel and quicksave. the second is addressing criticism: the artist gets to go back and fix all the inevitable galling failures that make revisiting art so painful. (if only writers could do this with their pieces.) and the final is accessibility. sometimes making goals easier or clearer; other times it means adding in options for disabled players. brown argued that by accomplishing all three, capcom made re feel fresh to old fans and neophytes alike.\n",
      "but crucially, brown points out, the original resident evil is still available. not so for titles like warcraft iii: reforged and the remake of grand theft auto: san andreas, both of which erased their previous iterations in favor of inferior remasters. this conundrum grows out of the public's relationship with consumer technologies. games are tied to the development of tech like processors and gpus; this means that games are also tied to the false vision of technological progress as a straight line of continuous improvement rather than a chaotic series of hit or miss implementations. video games often seem rooted in hype and obsoletion cycles, to be swept away like old iphones or social media accounts. (in this sense, games mirror the lack of preservation that exists across the internet broadly.)\n",
      "the less apparent baked in assumption here is that games are consistently improving, rather than passing through different artistic styles and trends. this idea differs from the mindset of players who see the original as a sacred text, and get annoyed at the most minor changes in lore or voice actors. but we do not think literature improves like science, and advancements in cgi have not improved films. watch nosferatu (now being remade by robert eggers) and you'll see f. w. murnau did just fine adapting bram stoker's dracula before the advent of sound and color.\n",
      "so artistic quality does not necessarily improve in lockstep with technology. but in games, there is a tendency to equate the new with better. yet, playing these four recent remakes, i was shocked by how the things that had survived felt so good: their \"linear\" worlds did not feel old fashioned. they fomented a desire to play the reboot and the original—and a hope that i will always be able to do both. \n",

      "Title: The Last AI Boom Didn't Kill Jobs. Feel Better?\n",
      "in a new research paper, economists looked at the job market across a number of european countries between and . that's the period during which the ai technique deep learning emerged as a powerful way to automate tasks like transcribing speech, analyzing images, and making algorithmic recommendations for social feeds and ecommerce sites. back then, deep learning was widely expected to have a broad and swift impact on employment.\n",
      "to check up on what really happened, researchers at the european central bank, spain's central bank, and the universities of oxford and pittsburgh used two established methods for measuring how vulnerable professions are to ai powered automation. both involved examining the tasks workers do and how they compare with the capabilities of algorithms. the researchers cross referenced that information with survey data on eu workers that shows the number of people leaving or joining different occupations in industries ranging from agriculture to financial services.\n",
      "the headline result was that industries where ai could be the most useful did not see a reduction of jobs. in fact, for more highly skilled jobs vulnerable to ai, such as white collar office work that involves working with data, there was around a percent increase in the number of employed workers. the researchers say this supports the idea that new technology can increase demand for more skilled workers at the same time that it replaces those who do routine work. less skilled workers didn't seem to be significantly affected by software or ai.\n",
      "although fears about new technologies taking jobs are common—and entirely understandable—economic research offers a complex, mixed picture. in general, many economists believe that automation can increase demand for jobs overall, as shown by some recent studies. if you are not one of those more skilled workers, however, the arrival of new technology might be a problem.\n",
      "none of this research makes it possible to predict what effect chatgpt or other generative ai technologies will have. they may be too new to cause noticeable changes. and it's possible that generative ai has an entirely different effect on jobs to what came before. \"while in the period of our analysis the association is positive, these results may not be extrapolated into the future,\" the authors of the new study write.\n",
      "generative ai is undeniably already causing some disruption. you don't have to look far to find stories of individuals and businesses that are already being changed by the kind of ai behind chatgpt.\n",
      "some copywriters, for instance, are having to find new careers after customers replaced them with generative ai tools. a number of publications are also experimenting with ai generated content. the german tabloid bild recently cited ai as one reason for planned job cuts.\n",
      "but let's not forget that tools like chatgpt are still unreliable coworkers, as they make up facts, reinforce biases, and can otherwise misbehave. and it's worth remembering that the emergence of deep learning in the s prompted some ai experts to predict the elimination of certain jobs, including radiologists—a prognostication that has hardly come true. \n",

      "Title: Could a Dutch apology for empire and slavery set a royal trend?\n",
      "is late truly better than never? when king willem alexander of the netherlands commemorates the th anniversary of the country's abolition of slavery on saturday (july ), he is widely expected to apologize for the dutch imperial slave trade. the weight of history is bearing down on the king. for decades campaigners in former dutch colonies in the caribbean have called on the netherlands to apologize and pay reparations for the brutal and systematic trade in human lives in the th and th centuries. the netherlands' reckoning with its past comes as some in europe grapple with the realities of their brutal colonial and slave holding history. an apology, which is widely expected, would pile pressure on the royal families of britain, belgium and other former slave trading european nations to do the same. the dutch royal palace said it does not comment on the king's upcoming speeches. still, anything short of an apology would cause uproar among activists. in december prime minister mark rutte apologized on behalf of the dutch government to the descendants of enslaved people. and on june , the sheer extent of dutch colonial enslavement was laid bare in a new government funded academic study called state and slavery that forensically tells the story of how the small north sea nation became a world leading economy in large part through its exploitation of forced labor. the netherlands' vast, lucrative network of human trafficking saw hundreds of thousands of people stolen from africa and sold in the caribbean and east asia — something that until now has not been widely known by the country's citizens, according to the study. it also doesn't fit the popular image of holland — as many netherlanders still call it — as a multicultural and tolerant democracy with a modern bicycle riding royal family. the study also describes how the king's predecessors made the equivalent of almost $ million from the slave trade, having invested nothing at the trade's height in the th and th centuries, more than , enslaved people were taken to suriname every year to work on sugar plantations, according to state and slavery. more than % of the population in what was then a south american colony were enslaved and conditions were so harsh that the number of births never outpaced the number of deaths, the study showed. the study's findings have surprised many in the netherlands, including those who read advance copies, said one of its editors, esther captain, an expert at the royal netherlands institute of southeast asian and caribbean studies, in the dutch city of leiden. \"i was shocked because you would assume that [it is] basic in general knowledge, but it's not,\" she told nbc news by telephone. \"i think it is to do with the fact that this is confronting our self image. we used to sell ourselves as tolerant, open minded and democratic. and i think this is challenging our very self image, and that hurts.\" the church, the navy and the royal family each played a part in the human trafficking of an estimated , people, mainly to suriname and the antilles islands in the caribbean. successive generations were born into this often deadly cycle of servitude. plantation owners busied themselves with reading, writing, sports and other leisure pursuits as workers toiled in the hot sun while facing physical and sexual abuse. the dutch began trading slaves in the s and became a major player in the s. slavery only ended in the dutch caribbean islands and suriname in — although some slaves were not freed for another years. the netherlands relented in the face of international pressure, not least from britain, which ended its part in the atlantic slave trade in . (the united states abolished slavery in .) slavery was also enforced in the dutch east indies — a major colony that included modern day indonesia — until the th century. in response to questions from nbc news, pauline van voorst, a spokesperson for the dutch government, echoed rutte's apology in admitting the country had too late in acting on the legacy of slavery. \"for centuries, under dutch state authority, human dignity was violated in the most horrific way possible. and successive dutch governments after failed to adequately see and acknowledge that our slavery past continued to have negative effects and still does,\" she said. on the question of reparations, she said that various assistance packages were already in place to help former colonies, designed to improve local economies. the state and slavery project was funded by a million euro (about $ million) commission to explore and expose the country's colonial past, announced by rutte in december. some countries have made similar moves and even paid reparations. king charles iii said in april that buckingham palace will cooperate with research into the british royalty's links to slavery, and belgium set up a commission to study its links in . belgian lawmakers spent hours last year debating whether and how to make an apology but came to no agreement, and the british project is not due to complete until . belgium's king philippe expressed his \"deepest regrets\" last june while on a trip to the democratic republic of the congo, where from to the government, under the supervision of king leopold ii, extracted a fortune in natural resources while enslaving, maiming, torturing and killing many thousands of people. britain has \"fallen behind the international conversation\" in owning up to its colonial past, said sathnam sanghera, a journalist and author of \"empireland,\" a bestselling book about the legacy of british colonialism. \"that the dutch have commissioned historians and given an apology just highlights how little we've done,\" he said. king charles' coronation, which included items glittering with precious gems taken from british colonies, underlined britain's imperial past. \"it kept coming up during the coronation, every other commonwealth was raising it, whether it was loot, slavery or the legacy of it,\" sanghera said. \"this is going to be the conversation for the next years.\" britain was an early and enthusiastic participant in the transatlantic slave trade in the th and th centuries, which helped build an empire that reigned over some million inhabitants at its height in the early th century. in , germany called its actions in namibia \"genocide\" and pledged . billion euros ($ . billion) in reparations, and the same year french president emmanuel macron apologized to algerians who fought alongside french forces but were later killed as traitors. \"you have germany doing that, you have the netherlands doing that. and it pressures belgium, who have kind of stuck their heels in the sand,\" said jeremiah garsha, an expert in colonial history at university college dublin. the state and slavery project made headlines last week for revealing how much money dutch kings made from slavery. but garsha added that reducing an entire country's colonial misdeeds to a number is in itself a continuation of the colonial attitude: that people can be financial assets. \"those are numbers that continue to kind of enslave people in our mindset — they're chattel, they're property. no. these are experiences, these are human experiences,\" he said. \"that's what i want to recover.\" \n",

      "Title: The 'moment has arrived' for digital creators. And they're here for it.\n",
      "anaheim, calif. — as vidcon has matured in recent years, so too have its attendees. this year the annual conference — for creators, fans and industry execs — brought together the likes of hollywood a list star keke palmer and youtube minecraft streamer dream. it also featured such panels as \"the new era of celebrity\" and \"stream to mainstream: hollywood's new rules of engagement.\" online content — often dismissed as less impressive or serious than traditional media — is proving to be an unignorable force in entertainment as the lines between digital, film and tv continue to blur. \"i mean, this in the nicest way,\" ian hecox, co founder of og youtube comedy channel smosh, said. vidcon has \"gone from weirdos to entrepreneurs.\" young people have increasingly turned to online video for entertainment. during the pandemic lockdown in , digital content on platforms like youtube and tiktok dominated, which experts at vidcon said helped propel digital media as a serious form of entertainment. \"we're not on a journey anymore,\" said amber tarshis, chief marketing officer at creator economy startup jellysmack. \"the moment has arrived. digital first talent are the power players today.\" with everyone at home, audiences ran out of new shows to watch on tv or stream, but creators kept people entertained with fresh content everyday. \"it really drove people into watching creators, not as a hobby thing but as another linear option,\" said joe gagliese, ceo of viral nation, an influencer marketing and talent management company. gagliese said that when he co founded viral nation in , many creators believed that the next step in their careers had to be crossing over to mainstream media. but creators are no longer just using social media as a jumping off point for bigger stardom. instead, online content is the end goal. over the years, content creation has become a serious and feasible career option for many. \"they all thought that the natural evolution of being a creator was becoming a celebrity,\" gagliese said. \"as the years went on, and some of them made the crossover and realized, 'i gotta go work a hour day for , bucks and they don't care who i am.' ... so they realize that like, that's a whole different grind than what they're used to.\" the transition from digital to mainstream media has not always been smooth, partly because executives have tried to force traditional growth models onto new age talent. in general, the relationship between digital talent and the hollywood executives who invest in them has been fraught in the past. creators felt many people coming from the traditional entertainment industry didn't \"get\" the internet. hecox and anthony padilla, co creators of smosh, can attest to this. the duo, who recently reunited after splitting up in to buy the brand back, has experienced the different phases and investments in the creator space since the two started their channel in . \"they had a lot of institutional knowledge from how things worked in a traditional space,\" hecox said of the first executives who tapped into digital. \"it wasn't really one for one when it came to digital. so there's just a lot of stuff that just wasn't very productive in the digital space. it's a very different world. it's a lot less money.\" the directive from some executives smosh worked with, padilla said, was to incorporate different elements into its youtube videos because they believed it would \"help the overall business.\" hecox said that toward the end of his and padilla's initial partnership, they gave priority to production quality in a way their audience didn't like. \"we had strayed too far away from digital and we started looking more like tv, and i think people didn't connect with that,\" hecox said. padilla and hecox now own their brand and have creative control over it. instead of stretching themselves thin to fit a traditional mold, they've redirected their focus to their roots and what fans liked the best. the entertainment industry has gradually improved its handling of digital creators, according to jade sherman, head of digital at a artists agency. sherman said in the early days some agencies treated digital as \"the ugly stepchild\" of the industry. now \"people aren't trying to fit digital talent into a traditional kind of medium and then just dropping them and saying good luck,\" she said. \"they're really trying to figure out, why should we be working with this creator in this kind of format? what makes it more impactful? what makes it different than what they're already doing? and the truth is, sometimes maybe that's not an option.\" alan chikin chow, who is represented by a , started his career as an actor but pivoted his focus to social media content, which has led to him becoming the most viewed youtube shorts creator with a dedicated fanbase. while he still takes on traditional projects, he said youtube has allowed him to create comedy and tell stories on his own terms. \"i think the thing that is really exciting about being a creator is you have the power to create your own brand, create your own voice, and really distill what it is that you want to say, without having to kind of fit into the narrative of somebody else's project,\" he said. traditional stars are increasingly seeing the value of digital content. superstars like dwayne \"the rock\" johnson and will smith have made successful and popular online content for years. now people like palmer and former disney channel actor christy carlson romano are building digital first media companies because of the creative freedom and reach they can achieve with that. romano said she wished she'd started making online content sooner, because it has allowed her to control her image, narrative and creative pursuits. she also said that she identifies as a content creator rather than a celebrity these days. \"it's as if you were your own network,\" romano said. \"i didn't need to wait for anybody anymore, and i would be the only person benefiting from my efforts. so it's very, very empowering.\" while creators and industry insiders are optimistic about the future of digital media, some say there's still a lot of work to be done. \"anything that becomes the main thing has problems,\" gagliese, of viral nation, said. \"so i think you'll see a lot of growing pains ... but if you can make it through the growing pains, and you can find that kind of steady space,\" this industry, he said, \"is going to become a monster.\" \n",

      "i've been saying it for months: get tiktok off your phone. it's not the only china based app you need to worry about. temu, the app that lets you \"shop like a billionaire,\" isn't worth the deals. here's why — and what to do if you've been using it. that's not all. here's a list of dangerous apps you need to delete asap. if you still want to use tiktok, you can without handing over all your information to communist china. why not just use the app? plain and simple, tiktok is a national security threat. the chinese owned social media platform's parent company bytedance is based in beijing and is required by chinese law to give the government access to collected data. tiktok collects data that includes search and browsing history, facial id, voice prints, texts, location, and photos. though government agencies and even the entire state of montana have banned the social media app, it's still incredibly popular — used by about two thirds of teens in the u.s. want my tech smarts straight to your inbox? less than minutes a day and loved by k readers. sign up for free. what are your options? browsing tiktok on the web won't cut it. there's still a significant amount of tracking. your best buy is buying a low cost smartphone, sometimes called a burner phone. you don't need anything fancy since this is just for social media. a super basic cheap android phone works just fine. turn on the phone and set it up, but here's the trick: don't link it to any of your primary accounts. start fresh do not log into your google account, apple id, company email, personal email, or anything else. certainly, don't give it access to any sensitive personal or financial information. create a new email account just for this phone — and your tiktok account. that way, even if tiktok (or any other app) collects data from your device, it won't be tied to your actual personal information. of course, this phone still has a connection to you. be careful what you share with the app or in your posts. you can connect the burner phone to your home's wi fi, so you don't need to purchase a cellular data plan. but there's one more important thing you need to do. tech : sick of slow wi fi? use these tips to fix yours. take care with your network, too when you connect a device to your home network, it's in the same digital space as your other devices. for instance, if your \"burner phone\" was infected with malware, that could potentially impact other devices on your network. since privacy and security are our focus here, take the time to set up a guest network in your home. this allows guests, or the devices you choose, to access the internet but not the other devices on your main network. most routers allow you to enable a \"guest network\" option in the settings. depending on your router, you may do this through an app or the web interface. you'll need the device's ip address and admin password to access your router admin page from a computer. these may be written on the user guide for your router brand, but some sites can help you find them if you don't have this information. tap or click here for a list of default passwords for router brands. look for a guest wi fi section, or you may find it under wireless settings. give your guest network its own name, different from your regular network, so you don't accidentally choose the wrong one on your new tiktok phone. keep your tech know going my popular podcast is called \"kim komando today.\" it's a solid minutes of tech news, tips, and callers with tech questions like you from all over the country. search for it wherever you get your podcasts. for your convenience, hit the link below for a recent episode. podcast pick: naughty wfh trend, suicide hotline data fiasco &amp; google's life questions plus, are we alone? i talk ufos and aliens with dr. seth shostak, senior astronomer for the seti institute. a georgia man sued meta — and won his case. the us buys up personal data, dating profile blunders and how to remove photos from real estate sites. check out my podcast \"kim komando today\" on apple, google podcasts, spotify, or your favorite podcast player. listen to the podcast here or wherever you get your podcasts. just search for my last name, \"komando.\" sound like a tech pro, even if you're not! award winning popular host kim komando is your secret weapon. listenon + radio stations or get the podcast. and join over , people who get her free minute daily email newsletter.  \n",

      "\"you probably have a lot of people who are struggling\" to process the information about their families, said burroughs. he said the granular detail reuters provided the leaders – names, places and circumstances linking their families to slavery – makes the information especially powerful. \"but it's hard for them to be in denial when they have the specific facts in front of them.\"\n",

      "one member of the th congress with a slaveholding ancestor, former representative mo brooks of alabama, questioned what the country has to gain from revisiting the topic.\n",
      "\"hopefully, everybody in america is smart enough to know that slavery is abhorrent,\" brooks, who lost a u.s. senate bid last year, said in a phone interview. \"so the question then becomes, if everybody already knows that it's abhorrent, what more can you teach from that?\"\n",
      "scholars say that establishing the grim details of the history of slavery is essential to understanding the nation's past and bridging racial divides.\n",
      "\"there's a kind of moral value to documenting this crime and acknowledging that happened, and getting into specifics about what its nature was, and that involves saying who was involved,\" said sean kelley, an american born professor at the university of essex who specializes in the transatlantic slave trade.\n",
      "knowing those specifics is crucial, kelley said, \"if there's to be a reconciliation of some kind, racially, in the united states.\"\n",
      "the reuters/ipsos survey offers some support for that view, too: it suggests that, for some americans, knowing of an ancestor's involvement in slavery can shape views on controversial policy questions.\n",
      "white respondents who said they're aware of having a slaveholding ancestor were more likely than other white people to support paying reparations: % backed the idea, compared to % who said their ancestors did not enslave people. the same held true for the idea of having congress create a commission to formally apologize for slavery: % of white people who said they knew of an ancestral tie to slaveholding supported it, versus % of those who said their families had not enslaved people.\n",

      "genealogists say white people who excavate their ancestry could help black americans by finding information that enables them to trace their own ancestries. black genealogy faces a special hurdle: before , census takers almost never recorded the names of the enslaved in the united states, instead listing ages and genders.\n",
      "in researching america's political elite, reuters found names – almost always just a first name – of people enslaved by the ancestors of the political elite. even with a first name, tracing those individuals forward to a census where they are recorded in full is often exceedingly difficult. but white families may have other documents – such as wills, plantation records or family bibles that list the names of the enslaved – or know where to find them.\n",
      "\"people don't realize how many documents are still in the family,\" said genealogist burroughs. he asked the leaders identified by reuters to \"go back and review their family archives, and see what documents they have pertaining to slavery and make them available to the public. that will help tremendously.\" those documents could be shared with a university library, a local or state historical society or other archives, genealogists say. \n",
      "lost wealth, lasting status\n",
      "for most of the forebears identified by reuters, slavery wasn't practiced on the vast plantations romanticized in works such as gone with the wind. only a few leaders had an ancestor whose slaveholdings were large enough to place them among the south's so called planter elites, operators of the largest tracts.\n",
      "in states where slavery was legal, reuters counted about one slaveholder for every four households in , based on census data from ipums' national historical geographic information system.\n",
      "most ancestors of members of congress typified the medium scale slaveholders of the antebellum south. an analysis of census data shows that in , on the eve of the civil war, the average number of people who congressional ancestors enslaved was slightly larger than for the average slaveholder: about people per forebear, compared with an average of across the south. most southern slaveholders enslaved fewer than people, however. the average was pulled higher by a comparatively small number of landowners who held larger numbers of people in captivity.\n",

      "\"you may remember – what was it – acres and a mule?\" brooks asked. \"now i'd have to check my history on how prevalent that was. but some freed slaves were given some amount of reparations, if my memory serves me correctly, and that is the origin of the phrase ' acres and a mule.'\"\n",
      "as harvard's gates wrote, sherman did issue a special order in calling for liberated families under his protection to be issued land and, later, a mule. the property in question was a strip of land down the country's southeastern coast.\n",
      "had the order been followed, it would have provided black americans assets upon which to build new lives and perhaps pass wealth to subsequent generations.\n",

      "nicka sewell smith, a professional genealogist with the family history website ancestry.com, said people frequently ask her what to do with such documents. \"'my mom had this set of papers in the attic and it has names of enslaved people ... where do i put it?'\" sewell smith said. (her suggestion is to upload them to ancestry.com, where others researching the same family can find them. the site requires a subscription.) more and more americans are interested in genealogy, she said, and they think, \"'oh, my gosh, i might be holding on to something in my house that other people need to even make a connection with their ancestors.'\"\n",

      "for service companies that experience a summer slowdown every year, finding ways to keep staff members productive during this time is crucial for maintaining momentum and utilizing resources effectively. while customer or client work may decrease, there are many valuable activities that employees can engage in to make the most of their and the company's time.\n",
      "here, forbes coaches council members highlight strategies companies can use to ensure teams remain productive during the summertime. from professional development and skills training to brainstorming sessions to make process improvements and enhance internal operations, check out the various avenues service companies can take to help team members focus their efforts in the most beneficial ways when business is slow below.\n",
      " . focus on free professional development\n",
      "during a summer slowdown, service companies can keep staff productive by focusing on free professional development, process improvement, research, team building, creative projects, networking and free employee well being initiatives. these activities maximize employee engagement and contribute to long term growth. foluso gbadamosi, folusogbadamosi.com\n",
      " . evaluate what can be improved\n",
      "i love saying, \"go slow to go fast,\" and summer slowdowns are a great time to invest in personal leadership development. leadership starts with the person. slow seasons are also great for evaluating which systems, tools or processes need to be revamped. lastly, the gift of \"free\" vacation time for employees (whether it is a day or more) from the company goes a long way to rejuvenate staff members for busy times. melissa deluca, deluca & willow\n",
      " . reflect on what has gone well and not so well\n",
      "during a summer slowdown, i would focus on three specific things: take time to reflect on what has gone well, what hasn't gone so well and what we can take forward. there is energy that can be taken from reminding ourselves of our success, and learning is invaluable for growth. second, sharpen the saw and focus on personal development. finally, i would look at high impact, short burst projects to set us up for success. ricky muddimer, thinking focus\n",
      "more fromforbes advisorbest travel insurance companiesbyamy daniseeditorbest covid travel insurance plansbyamy daniseeditor\n",
      " . maximize employees' talent\n",
      "ask employees what they want to contribute in specific areas of the business that will further a certain strategic goal, and then agree on the parameters. this will keep them engaged and excited to be contributing to a valuable, possibly new function for when the business will be back in the swing of things! cellene hoogenkamp, kokuahub inc\n",
      " . prepare to cope with future challenges\n",
      "a popular saying advises that \"you have to redo your roof when the weather is nice!\" a business slowdown is a very good time to step back from the daily routines and do a strategic review of activities. here are some questions to answer: \"are we prepared for the next challenges? are we investing enough in people, technologies and innovation to cope with future challenges, both ecological and social?\" catherine tanneau, activision coaching institute\n",

      " . get strategic and build new, faster systems\n",
      "when business is slow, get strategic! any slowdown is a perfect time to invest in building new systems to handle scale and speed. when you have space in the calendar is the time to build templates, processes and business continuity systems, as well as purge inventory and document libraries. slow times are when you lay the foundation to make the faster times smooth! david taylor klaus, mcc, cpcc, ctpc, dtk coaching, llc\n",
      " . brainstorm future services\n",
      "during slowdowns, companies get an incredible opportunity to work on building their team, planning forward, brainstorming future services, reviewing their current processes, testing services for validation and training on new skills that the team may need. this opportunity allows for great growth inside a company if used wisely. bobbie goheen, synthesis management group\n",
      " . tie up loose ends, then rest and recharge\n",
      "there is an ebb and flow in life and in business. the key here is to understand that everything is cyclical and change is always around the corner. i encourage my clients to take advantage of the slower times and work on the business by tying up loose ends, getting organized in house, strategizing on business development and doing some fun team building activities. rest and recharge for the busy season—it's coming! cheryl keates, pcc, cheryl keates\n",
      " . conduct team building activities\n",
      "a slow period is the perfect time to evaluate the efficiency of the business. looking at department policies, processes and service offerings to determine if any changes are necessary will allow the company to help more customers during the busy season. this is also a great time for team building through volunteer days, cleaning the space, and training and development. lindsay miller, reverie organizational development specialists\n",
      " . focus on meeting training goals\n",
      "focusing on meeting training goals for personal and professional development can effectively fill the time during a summer slowdown for service based companies. this reminds employees they have the power to move the needle in their career trajectories and builds their growth mindset. ariel mcgrew, tactful disruption ® \n",
      " . cross train employees\n",
      "one of the strategies that companies can use to keep their staff members productive during the summertime is to cross train employees. by teaching staff members new skills or having them work in different areas of the business, you can help them stay motivated and prevent boredom or burnout. it is also a great way to keep them engaged and productive when facing a summer slowdown. paula vidal castelli, paula vidal castelli intl., llc\n",
      " . hire a development trainer or facilitator\n",
      "a summer slowdown is the best period to use spare time for learning and development so that staff members can sharpen their skills and knowledge or learn new skills to be ready for the peak season. hiring a trainer or facilitator can be a great way to ensure learning and development will not only benefit personal growth, but also business growth. senem anataca, utc\n",
      " . work on improving internal operations\n",
      "one of my favorite quotes is, \"you do not rise to the level of your goals. you fall to the level of your systems,\" by james clear. if there is downtime, businesses should always be working on improving internal operations, such as processes, it systems and so forth. this will not only likely save the business money, but it also will increase the engagement of your team. wendy fong, chief gigs\n",
      " . conduct market and user research\n",
      "here are three ways companies can take advantage of slow times during the summer: . hire a training company to train staff on new systems, such as ai technologies. . carry out business process improvement initiatives by mapping out, analyzing and improving existing processes. . conduct market and user research—review all customer databases as well as competitors' data, and create an improvement action plan for the busy periods. eno eka, the business analysis school\n",

      " . reflect on where you are and start a passion project\n",
      "a common frustration i hear from successful people is that they struggle to make time for strategic thinking. a natural slow point is perfect for reflecting on your direction of travel and on the balance you're striking. how do you really feel about the life you are creating? where do you want to course correct? then use passion projects as a vehicle for indulging and expanding your capabilities. duncan skelton, duncan skelton coaching ltd\n",

      "companies should be encouraging teams to take paid time off with family and friends during the summer months. research shows that offering sabbaticals is the best way to get people to return to the office refreshed, more grateful and more productive than they were before they left. so, organizations should allow more time off in the summer so that employees come back refreshed and do their best work. carmelina piedra, careercoachingpro\n",

      "amid a slew of allegations of physical and emotional abuse against romantic partners and toxicity on film sets, jonathan majors' lawyers say his \"method acting\"—an immersive acting process that some swear by, but critics say can be bothersome and disruptive for coworkers—may have been misconstrued as rudeness on film sets.\n",
      "jonathan majors will appear in court in august after being charged with assault and aggravated ... [+] harassment. hope he doesn't stay \"in character.\"cindy ord/vf /getty images for vanity fair\n",
      "key facts\n",
      "method acting, also known as \"the method,\" based on the early s teachings of russian director konstantin stanislavski and popularized in the united states by director lee strasberg, is a technique in which actors \"use their physical, mental and emotional self in the creation of a character\" to achieve an authentic performance, according to the lee strasberg institute.\n",
      "some celebrated method acting performances include strasberg student robert de niro's work in taxi driver and raging bull, for the latter of which he gained pounds to play a retired boxer.\n",
      "the modern understanding of method acting has diverted from stanislavski's original teachings, according to i d magazine, which reported that method acting is now associated with never breaking character and going to great lengths to fully inhabit characters, which has become popularized by the media.\n",
      "some modern method actors who choose to live as their characters onand off camera have garnered criticism for disruptive on set behavior.\n",
      "jared leto's method techniques have frequently made headlines, including an instance while filming suicide squad ( ), in which he starred as the joker, when he sent co stars margot robbie and viola davis a live rat and a dead pig, respectively.\n",
      "other infamous method acting techniques include leonardo dicaprio sleeping in an animal carcass for the revenant and daniel day lewis being pushed around in a wheelchair and spoon fed by the crew of my left foot.\n",
      "some non method actors who have worked with method actors say their process makes the work environment more difficult, like martin freeman, who called his man on the moon co star jim carrey's method acting process \"self aggrandizing, selfish\" and \"narcissistic.\"\n",
      "chief critics\n",
      "in conversation with jennifer lopez for the variety studio: actors on actors series, robert pattinson said: \"you only ever see people do the method when they're playing assholes. you never see someone being lovely to everyone while they're really deep in character.\" lopez agreed, stating after years of making movies she often can't wait to go home and let go of her characters. sebastian stan said method acting \"reads like an irresponsible, narcissistic thing. it reads like, 'i'm afraid, and i want to torture everyone else because of it.'\" some have also criticized modern conceptions of method acting for straying from stanislavski's teachings. jon bernthal said he doesn't see the benefit of method acting, but criticized how far the technique has strayed from stanislavski's teachings: \"making everybody call you by your character name and not showering for eight months was not what stanislavski had in mind with the method,\" he told the hollywood reporter last year. will poulter criticized actors using method acting \"as an excuse for inappropriate behavior,\" stating an actor's process shouldn't infringe on other people's work environment. jeremy strong, star of the hbo hit succession, made headlines for comments from co workers about his intense process on the set (which he does not consider method), which kieran culkin said \"doesn't help me\" and brian cox called \"f—— annoying,\" adding he worries about what it does to him mentally.\n",
      "contra\n",
      "andrew garfield defended method acting last year, stating it is \"not about being an asshole to everyone on set. it's actually just about living truthfully under imagined circumstances.\" he criticized misconceptions of method acting and stated the technique helped him on the film silence. some stars, including strong and tony kushner, defended method actor daniel day lewis, who famously goes to great lengths for his roles, both of who worked with him on lincoln. after a new yorker article detailing strong's immersive acting process went viral, jessica chastain and anne hathaway defended his process. \"when we talk about process, when we talk about intensity, when we talk about method, when we talk about all this stuff, it's all good to me. nothing ever strikes me as weird,\" hathaway said.\n",
      "key background\n",
      "majors, who maintains he is innocent, was arrested in march on charges of strangulation, assault and harassment of a year old woman, who referred to majors as her partner in text messages shared with tmz by majors' attorney priya chaudry. multiple alleged abuse victims of majors have since come forward and cooperated with legal authorities, and majors was subsequently dropped by talent agency entertainment and pr firm the lede co. he also lost several film roles, including the upcoming film adaptation of the walter mosley novel the man in my basement, in which he was supposed to star and serve as executive producer, as well as an otis redding biopic. majors appeared in court in june for a hearing in which his trial date was set for august . a rolling stone investigation published thursday, based on interviews with more than sources granted anonymity, alleges that majors physically abused one romantic partner, emotionally abused two romantic partners and treated crew members on film sets poorly. majors' attorney denied the allegations raised in the rolling stone article. \"everyone who has worked with mr. majors knows that he employs an immersive method acting style, and while that can be misconstrued as rudeness at times, those who know mr. majors and work in the industry have attested to his dedication to his craft as well as his kindness,\" his lawyer dustin pusch told indiewire.\n",

      "Title: How The Robotics Business Model Is Shifting To Meet Manufacturers Where They’re At\n",
      "share to facebookshare to twittershare to linkedinwhen i was a kid, the idea of a real life robot felt foreign. earth was for humans. the jetsons and their robot maid, rosie, existed only on television.\n",
      "now i work in manufacturing and frequently find myself advising companies that, you know that job you can't find the right person to fill? that process you haven't perfected? for that role, perhaps you should consider something a bit more metal.\n",
      "the pushback, and there is plenty, tends to sound a lot alike. it's too expensive. or, it takes too long to set up. or, we just don't have the tech skills to handle that sort of thing.\n",
      "but what if i told you that you don't need any special skills. that there are folks who will do the setup—and even the maintenance—for you. that it may not be as pricey as you think, particularly when you weigh a robot's productivity against a human being— or beings — in the same role.\n",
      "for manufacturers, the fear of robots is real. manufacturers fear their investments won't amount to anything, that they'll be bogged down by maintenance and end up even worse off.\n",
      "but i say fear not, because these days there are business models that cater to smalland medium sized manufacturers who don't have the in house staff to manage robots on their own.\n",
      "make technology more affordable with robotics as a service\n",
      "one such model is used by rapid robotics, a san francisco based company that provides robotics as a service. ceo and co founder jordan kretchmer saw the high costs falling on manufacturers installing robots. industrial robots could cost anywhere from $ , to $ , , the company says. even with rent a robot programs popping up to lower the hardware burden, manufacturers were stuck with implementation costs often soaring into the six figures.\n",
      "as an alternative, rapid provides both ends of that equation — the physical robot and the implementation, plus ongoing maintenance and reprogramming — at a flat, monthly fee. their low risk model shields customers from high startup costs and ensures they'll be able to adjust and recalibrate the robot as needs evolve. that happens often when it comes to things like injection mold operations, cnc loading, palletizing, packing and labeling boxes, and other tasks that are otherwise ripe for automation. \"those tasks tend to change over a lot,\" kretchmer says. \"meaning if you automate it with a very specific kind of machine and a very specifically programmed robot, the chances that the operation is going to remain the same for the next two or three years is really, really slim these days.\"\n",
      "more fromforbes advisorbest travel insurance companiesbyamy daniseeditorbest covid travel insurance plansbyamy daniseeditor\n",
      "rapid's service is not necessarily cheap. for a basic robotics arm work cell, it costs $ , per year — paid monthly — plus a one time onboarding fee of an additional $ , . but kretchmer says those numbers stack up favorably versus the cost of talent, providing companies with positive roi faster than they'd experience with a large initial investment. depending on how many shifts you're running it, the cost of the cobot — or collaborative robot — breaks down to about $ . or $ an hour after year one. the company also offers larger cobots which, at the high end, are priced at $ , for a yearly subscription plus $ , in one time onboarding costs. but those machines can replace tasks that usually take two or three people to complete.\n",
      "kretchmer ultimately believes raas can help companies begin to reshore parts of their operation to build resiliency. \"those little bits and bobs that were so easy to outsource, but that are critical components to really important products,\" he says. \"those need to be made locally.\"\n",
      "get expert help to customize and find the right solution\n",
      "rapid robotics has created a promising model. but it's not the only way to institute a high quality cobot into your manufacturing firm.\n",
      "just ask the school lunch maker innovative food services. founded in , the company grew from a modest restaurant catering business serving or meals a day to a school lunch focused business that pumps out , meals daily. ifs has had to scale their operations quickly.\n",
      "along the way, one job on the assembly line was constantly creating problems for ceo thomas lane's staff. it was a position at the end of the line in which an employee would take the meal trays and stack them inside large plastic totes, with a lot of twisting and turning and bending along the way. the role was a back killer, and even rotating various employees in an out of it during each day was causing inordinate amounts of strain. so, one day, ifs reached out to magnet, the nonprofit manufacturing consultancy i run out of cleveland.\n",
      "we worked with a robotics provider to build and deploy a custom cobot that took the place of that difficult, end of line job. \"switching over to the cobot, they're able to line up six meals, pick up all six, move them over and drop them down into totes,\" lane says. \"not only has it increased the speed and the efficiency of our line, but also our worker satisfaction. it was a win all the way around.\"\n",
      "ifs would end up purchasing two cobots, one for each of their assembly lines. within days of building, plus a couple more to train staff for regular maintenance, the company was up and running. all in all, lane says the cobots were less expensive than expected, paying for themselves within about months.\n",
      "\"i just encourage other manufacturers to really take that leap if they're on the fence about it,\" lane says.\n",
      "the future of robotics\n",
      "it's difficult to say what's coming next for robotics. business models like the one rapid robotics deploys are attractive in their simplified, all in one approach. but it remains to be seen whether manufacturers are willing to trade out one time investments — however large they may be — for the subscription model.\n",
      "regardless, there's a lot to be encouraged about when it comes to robotics deployment, from the largest manufacturers to some of the smallest. robotics companies are beginning to realize that the average manufacturer needs help implementing their technology, and they're getting creative and finding implementation partners to provide that expertise. the reward will be sizable: investments in robots contributed percent of the gdp growth in oecd countries from to , according to one study. and robotics capabilities have only continued to improve.\n",
      "we may be yet to build the world envisioned on the jetsons, but robots have arrived and are here to stay — and that's a good thing for manufacturers.\n",

      "we were in an apartment for months in australia while all the biggest parts of the covid drama were going on. so i didn't have access to a real piano for nearly two years. i had the mic that i bought right before lockdown. and my laptop. that freed me up to do things that were ridiculous... like that. i did some other things that were ridiculous but that climbed its way to the top of the ridiculous pile.\n",
      "and then there was inner debate about whether to put that on the record or not. the record was turning conceptual in a way — and sober and earnest. so why do this to myself? why have one star taken off my record on everyone's review just to be silly like that?\n",

      "you spent some of the pandejo teaching music online. what did you learn from that?\n",
      "that's scary because when you start teaching like that, it wakes the intellect up while you're writing, which i don't like to do. it's kinda like, you're hearing inner voices you shouldn't be hearing. everything i ever learned in music had the effect of making me worse for a period of time before it sinks in. i would get very self conscious after doing these lessons. 'well let's see what the fucking professor's got to say.'\n",

      "i can't imagine a convergence of those things again or the motivation to do it. i think rock records are, as i've said in my little book, for the mating age. it's the music to figuring out who you are, where you're going, who your fucking parents were that you're not. and yearning.\n",
      "the wedding, the pregnancy, the job... it's life and it's wonderful, but it's not rock'n'roll. we don't need that music anymore. time to let the kiddies come up and do it.\n",

      "strong brand governance is all about managing how you show up in the world and ensuring it's done in a way that reflects consistency in how customers engage with your brand. this goes for everything—from each logo and asset your brand has to the way your company's brand voice is activated across channels and markets.\n",
      "why is this important? well, it impacts the bottom line. consistent branding helps build awareness and recognition, which is important for success. according to a statista study, % of participants acknowledged that consistency played a part in contributing to at least % of their company's revenue.\n",
      "take a company like nike, for example. from its iconic \"swoosh\" to its powerful \"just do it\" messaging, nike's branding is instantly recognizable and has inspired long term loyalty among its fans. that wasn't achieved overnight but was a painstaking process of investing in its brand and showing up consistently across every customer touch point over many decades.\n",
      "historically, managing this process would be very top down and hierarchical. the traditional model would have one brand manager act as the sole guardian of a company's brand identity, overseeing every customer facing campaign, product and communication that went through its rigorous approval process before reaching the public.\n",
      "more fromforbes advisorbest travel insurance companiesbyamy daniseeditorbest covid travel insurance plansbyamy daniseeditor\n",
      "though this \"iron fist\" approach offers a comforting sense of control, in reality, it's an illusion. in a world where assets are being created for dozens of channels and markets all around the world, this type of approval model is not easily scalable and cannot move as fast as brand managers need it to. that's why we're increasingly seeing brands adopt a \"lean\" approach—a fresh take on brand governance that boosts collaboration and enthusiasm and makes ownership of brand governance everybody's business.\n",
      "accountability breeds responsibility, but how do you get your people to buy in?\n",
      "when your team members care about your brand and feel pride in it, they are much more likely to go the extra mile and care about using the right assets.\n",
      "at the heart of any successful branding strategy are the people who champion it, which is why it's essential to have brand champions in each department who truly understand your brand's essence and values. these ambassadors must possess a deep understanding of your brand's story and be able to seamlessly articulate its nuances to their colleagues. they are equipped with the knowledge and tools to help their peers find and utilize different brand assets in their daily work.\n",
      "so how do you help people play that pivotal role in your organization? the first thing to prioritize is removing friction. we all know how frustrating it is when you can't find the latest version of an asset, and this is where mistakes can creep in. one way to simplify things is to implement a digital asset management system that centralizes a company's brand assets so that everyone—wherever they sit in the business—knows how to use the right logos, images, videos and collateral in their work. this reduces the need for time consuming email exchanges, increases efficiency and helps swerve the likelihood of publication errors. and while technology isn't the one stop shop answer to all brand compliance challenges, companies can use a range of tools to help manage their brand—from guideline and design tools to entire platforms dedicated to asset management and collaborative working.\n",
      "investing in training whenever you introduce these types of systems is key. providing additional resources such as tutorials from the design department, creative templates for frequently used brand assets, and comprehensive brand guidelines, for both global and local markets, can be invaluable. when everyone has a shared understanding of the brand's importance, employees can see beyond bright colors and flashy logos and feel a deeper investment in their work. this can help them become more engaged and invested in their roles, ultimately fostering a sense of ownership that encourages them to take greater responsibility for the brand's success.\n",
      "breaking free from brand policing: empowering brand guardians for long term success\n",
      "brand policing is a trend of the past. today's consumers demand transparency and consistency across all platforms, and brands that empower their employees to become brand guardians are the ones that will succeed in the long run.\n",
      "this is underscored by recent findings from a survey by sprout social, which found that \" % of americans believe transparency from businesses is more important than ever before.\"\n",
      "as digital channels increasingly become the primary means of connecting with customers, taking a top down approach to brand governance is no longer feasible to holistically maintain a brand's health.\n",
      "this shift toward collective ownership allows for a more organic approach to brand management, enabling individuals to take ownership of their contributions and make informed decisions that align with the brand's values and mission. the brands that successfully trust their people to take this step will be the ones that turn one brand manager into an army of brand guardians.\n",
      "by providing a central hub for teams to collaborate on brand guidelines, assets and projects, everyone in the organization is enabled to have access to the information and tools they need to become brand guardians. and in turn, these brand guardians will be committed to the long term protection and enhancement of your brand.\n",

      "Title: Gay male couples face more challenges, higher costs to start a family\n",
      "watch nowvideo : : gay men face more challenges and higher costs to start familysquawk boxbret shuford and stephen hanna knew from early on in their relationship they wanted to raise a child together. but the married couple didn't think a biological child was a possibility.as freelancers in the creative arts, shuford and hanna don't always see steady income, even when working on broadway. the houston based couple, known as the \"broadway husbands,\" thought having a child with a donor egg and gestational carrier \"seemed like it was something that was only available to people who were very wealthy,\" said shuford, .it's a safe assumption that having a child with a surrogate, now most often called a gestational carrier, is cost prohibitive. while expenses vary widely due to a number of medical and legal factors, \"the average cost of surrogacy in america has gone from $ , five years ago, to anywhere between $ , and $ , today,\" according to dr. brian levine, a reproductive endocrinologist who founded surrogacy matching platform nodal.more from personal finance:how lgbtq+ seniors can tackle their special caregiving challengesfinancial advisor: here are important money tips for parents with young kidsteenagers are in high demand as summer hiring surge gets under wayin the u.s., there are only about , successful surrogacy journeys per year, nodal estimates.\"that's only about % of met need,\" levine said. \"in plain english, % of the people that dream of starting or growing or completing a family with surrogacy will not be able to do so in america due to the sheer time and cost constraints that are there today.\"why gay male couples face higher costsalon rivel, left, with his family.courtesy alon rivelalon rivel always wanted to be a father. \"as i grew up, i realized i was gay,\" said rivel, . \"so i thought, this will never happen for me. i don't have the money, but i wanted it desperately.\"\"we were shocked when we started to look into [having a biological child] and realized nothing is covered by insurance unless you can prove that you're infertile,\" said rivel, who lives in arlington, massachusetts. he and his husband believed that \"this is complete discrimination on the insurance company's part because we are gay men.\"\"it is not a choice,\" rivel added. \"we were born this way and, thus, we are actually infertile.\"experts say the demand for surrogacy relationships has grown since same sex marriage became legal in the u.s. in .gay male couples typically face a more expensive journey, as surrogacy or adoption are their primary choices. in contrast, same sex female couples are often able to carry pregnancies to term on their own, though they may possibly have to pay for donor sperm and fertilization.sadly, we do see in some states that there are laws that discriminate against the lgbtq+ community.betsy campbellchief engagement officer for resolve: the national infertility associationdonor eggs are exponentially more expensive than donor sperm largely because the egg retrieval process is more invasive and complicated. while costs, again, vary wildly, donor eggs and the associated costs can range between $ , and $ , , according to fertility marketplace gostork, while donor sperm can be from as little as several hundred dollars to around $ , .donor eggs, meanwhile, are only one of many expenses.shuford and hanna's health insurance covered only the tests done on their sperm samples. their remaining expenses, they estimate, ran between $ , and $ , . that included around $ , for donor eggs, the medical costs to create, store, test and freeze embryos, medical insurance and out of pocket medical costs for their gestational carrier, her compensation, and other expenses.the couple used savings, credit cards and high interest loans to cover that tab. rivel and his husband's journey to parenthood ultimately cost $ , .\"we're taking money away from our child's college fund,\" he said. \"we're taking money away from our mortgage.\"\"compared to [many of] our friends, our baseline is $ , below where they started,\" rivel added.employer fertility benefits offer limited helpmore employers are starting to offer fertility benefits, often through a specialized fertility benefits manager such as kindbody, carrot, progyny or maven. in , % of u.s. employers offered some type of fertility coverage, up from % in , according to the international foundation of employee benefit plans.fertility iq, which keeps a workplace index of employer fertility benefits, found the average amount of fertility coverage in was $ , per lifetime, flat from the year before.but while more companies are offering fertility benefits, many of these packages are limited when it comes to covering what's needed to build families using non traditional methods. almost two thirds, %, of lgbtq+ people plan to use assisted reproductive technology, foster care or adoption to become parents, according to a survey by family equality.yet fewer than half of employers offering fertility benefits provided any benefits for adoption, and only about % provided benefits related to surrogacy, according to a survey from resolve: the national infertility association and health care consultancy mercer. and state laws requiring employers of a certain size to offer fertility benefits often leave out coverage for third party reproduction such as a gestational carrier or the purchase of donor eggs or donor sperm.\"i honestly believe that employers don't realize there is a gap in their benefits. and they often don't know this until an employee points that out,\" said betsy campbell, chief engagement officer for resolve.she said many employers she speaks to have \"the best intentions\" but don't understand how gestational surrogacy works or how family building benefits fall short.will porteous, , became a father through gestational surrogacy before joining maven as its chief growth officer. he and his husband tabulated their parenthood path cost at close to $ , . \"no employer in the entire country that i'm aware of offers anything greater than $ , a year, and so that only covers a portion.\" will porteous, right, with his husband, doug, and their son, walter.courtesy will porteousbut porteous, who lives in wynnewood, pennsylvania, said full coverage isn't necessarily what lgbtq+ couples want to see. \"the expectation is to have equitable support to your other co workers and seeing that your employer cares about that journey,\" he said.that employer support, porteous said, \"really means a lot and it shows that you as an employer care about your employee, regardless of how they're going to build their family.\"fertility benefits can help recruit, retain talentwhile fertility benefits manager progyny's first clients were largely west coast \"silicon valley type\" businesses, according to ceo pete anevski, it now works with employers in industries.\"there's a flywheel effect happening,\" he said, with more companies realizing benefits need to include family building coverage \"to be competitive, to attract and retain talent in what is still a tight labor market, an inflationary economy, even with concerns around a looming recession.\" fertility benefits manager carrot said it has around corporate clients and % of those offer their employees a benefit for surrogacy. \"we have seen an increase in surrogacy claims year over year at about %,\" said ceo tammy sun. offering these types of benefits can be key factors for a company when job candidates are making decisions about employment, said taryn branca, chief revenue officer at kindbody.\"i can't tell you how many of our clients will call us, we will get on the phone with potential candidates that they're recruiting, or we will provide information to support that recruit coming there because they are asking for very specific information before they'll accept the offer: if they have surrogacy benefits, if they have donor benefits,\" she said.more than half of respondents in a new progyny survey of lgbtq+ community members said they are actively looking to build their families. of that population, % would consider leaving their current job for one that offers better fertility and family building benefits, and % would consider taking a second job to receive those benefits.\"this is not a 'nice to have,' this is a 'need to have' benefit,\" anevski said.rivel's husband is an early employee at massachusetts based beam therapeutics. at rivel's insistence, he asked his human resources department to look into including surrogacy benefits. eventually, the company added a surrogacy reimbursement benefit, which at the time rivel and his husband used it was worth $ , . while $ , was a small dent in the couple's $ , surrogacy journey, rivel said it's better than nothing. \"it's really admirable that they have it,\" he said. \"i think it's a really smart benefit for recruiting more people.\"adoption also comes with high costs, risksadoption is certainly another family building option. \"it's not for everyone ... it's not without its costs, and the laws vary by state,\" resolve's campbell said. \"sadly, we do see in some states that there are laws that discriminate against the lgbtq+ community, so that's definitely a consideration.\"the average nonfoster system adoption costs between $ , and $ , , according to the child welfare information gateway. as with surrogacy relationships, the adopting parents cover related expenses for all parties, from medical to legal, plus living expenses if a match is made in advance of a birth. and, of course, there are no guarantees.shuford and hanna decided adoption wasn't a path for them. \"there's a lot of risks involved that we weren't willing to take,\" hanna said. \"we had heard of stories involving birth mothers changing their minds, and children having birth defects that without [genetic embryo testing] weren't known.\"'it was totally worth it'stephen hanna, left, with his husband, bret shuford, and their son, maverick.courtesy bret shuford and stephen hannalike many gestational carrier stories, shuford and hanna's was far from easy or straightforward.their first carrier dropped out of the process shortly before the embryo transfer was scheduled to take place but well after contracts had been signed and medical assessments and travel had occurred. the covid pandemic delayed the process with their second gestational carrier; then, after the first embryo transfer, the pregnancy ended in a devastating miscarriage. the second embryo transfer worked, and their surrogate gave birth to their son, maverick, in .\"so many times, we felt very excluded,\" shuford said. \"we want to be able to have a family and raise our child and have that child be biologically related to us, and we have a right to do that, and we have a right to feel seen and validated in that process.\"but for shuford, \"in the end, it was totally worth it.\"\"i mean, maverick is amazing,\" he added. \"and we're so lucky to have a healthy baby and also having someone like crystal, our surrogate who carried our child.\"\"i don't know that i've ever experienced that kind of love in my life,\" shuford said. \"so it's really a powerful experience.\"

based company plans to trade on the nasdaq using the ticker odd. the company didn't immediately disclose how the offering would be priced in regulatory filings and declined comment when asked when the numbers would be released.\"the number of shares to be offered and the price range for the proposed offering have not yet been determined. the offering is subject to market conditions, and there can be no assurance as to whether or when the offering may be completed, or as to the actual size or terms of the offering,\" oddity said in a press release.launched in by brother and sister duo oran holtzman and shiran holtzman erel, oddity uses data and ai to develop brands and make tailored product recommendations for customers.the business is seeking to disrupt a market long dominated by legacy retailers by replacing the in store experience with product recommendations driven by ai and data. at the heart of its business model is its proprietary technology — including tech developed by a former israeli defense official — and the billions of data points it has collected from its millions of users.in the three months that ended march , the company saw $ . million in revenue, up from $

profits have climbed. during its most recent fiscal year, which ended march , it saw $ . million in sales and a net income of $ . million. as a direct to consumer retailer, oddity is seeing the high margins that come along with the strategy. in the three months that ended march , its gross margins were %, up percentage points from % in the year ago period. its annual margins have slipped each year since as the company has made acquisitions and invested in growing the business.in , oddity had an annual gross margin of %, and in , it dropped percentage point to %. in , the retailer's annual

and , respectively. as of friday, oddity has launched in the u.s., canada, u.k., continental europe and australia. it noted it has plans to keep growing that footprint.the company plans to use

an interview earlier this year, the company's global chief financial officer, lindsay drucker mann, a former goldman sachs executive, told cnbc that oddity is making money and growing — even against a

the empires that incumbents had built over decades had not evolved with the times, resulting in a significant lag in online adoption,\" holtzman wrote in a founder's letter enclosed in a securities filing.\"their underinvestment in technology left the category behind the digital curve, despite a consumer who is inherently primed to buy online — spending significant time on social media for beauty content and rapidly shifting dollars online in other categories.\"(l to r): dr. david zhang, oddity's new head of bioengineering and the chief science officer and co founder of revela; oddity

new products and brands, oddity is also trying to make beauty products more effective, the company has said. in late april, it announced it was investing more than $ million to acquire biotech startup revela and open a u.s. based lab.the merger brought to oddity a team of scientists tasked with creating brand new molecules, using artificial intelligence, that can be used in its cosmetics brands and future lines.in , oddity acquired voyage , a deep tech ai based computational imaging startup founded in by niv price, the former head of research and development for one of the israeli defense forces' elite technological units, along with dr. boaz arad, dr. rafi gidron and omer shwartz.the technology is capable of mapping and analyzing skin and hair features, detecting facial blood flows, and creating melanin and hemoglobin maps using a regular smartphone camera.the filing comes after a year and a half of a drought in the initial public offering market, which is just beginning to open up and show signs of green shoots. earlier this month, mediterranean restaurant chain cava went public, and its shares soared as much as % in its market debut. \"[in ] investors didn't want to go anywhere near ipos but now that they're making money again, and with issuers seeing that they can achieve close to decent valuations, i think that's bringing the people back into the market,\" said matt kennedy, a senior ipo market strategist for renaissance capital.\"the consumer sector does lend itself to these periods where investors can see a business model that they understand, a business that they might be familiar with and also one that is typically profitable or near profitable, preferably that has growth.\" \n",

      "file photo: the port bow railing of the titanic lies in , feet of water about miles east of nova scotia as photographed as part of a joint scientific and recovery expedition sponsored by the discovery channel and rms titantic.stringer | file photorescuers in a remote area of the atlantic ocean raced against time tuesday to find a missing submersible before the oxygen supply runs out for five people who were on a mission to document the wreckage of the titanic.despite an international rescue effort, u.s. coast guard officials said the search covering , square miles ( , square kilometers) had turned up no signs of the lost sub known as the titan, but they planned to continue looking.authorities reported the carbon fiber vessel overdue sunday night, setting off the search in waters about miles ( kilometers) south of st. john's, newfoundland. aboard were a pilot, renowned british adventurer hamish harding, two members of an iconic pakistani business family and a titanic expert.the submersible had a hour oxygen supply when it put to sea at roughly a.m. sunday, according to david concannon, an adviser to oceangate expeditions, which oversaw the mission.that means the oxygen supply could run out thursday morning.cbs news journalist david pogue, who traveled to titanic aboard the titan last year, said the vehicle uses two communication systems: text messages that go back and forth to a surface ship and safety pings that are emitted every minutes to indicate that the sub is still working.both of those systems stopped about an hour and minutes after the titan submerged.\"there are only two things that could mean. either they lost all power or the ship developed a hull breach and it imploded instantly. both of those are devastatingly hopeless,\" pogue told cbc on tuesday.the submersible had seven backup systems to return to the surface, including sandbags and lead pipes that drop off and an inflatable balloon. one system is designed to work even if everyone aboard is unconscious, pogue said.experts said the rescuers face steep challenges.us coast gurad captain jamie frederick speaks during a press conference about the search efforts for the submersible that went missing near the wreck of the titanic, at coast guard base in boston, massachusetts, on june , .joseph prezioso | afp | getty imagesalistair greig, a professor of marine engineering at university college london, said submersibles typically have a drop weight, which is \"a mass they can release in the case of an emergency to bring them up to the surface using buoyancy.\"\"if there was a power failure and/or communication failure, this might have happened, and the submersible would then be bobbing about on the surface waiting to be found,\" greig said.another scenario is a leak in the pressure hull, in which case the prognosis is not good, he said.\"if it has gone down to the seabed and can't get back up under its own power, options are very limited,\" greig said. \"while the submersible might still be intact, if it is beyond the continental shelf, there are very few vessels that can get that deep, and certainly not divers.\"even if they could go that deep, he doubts rescuers could attach to the submersible.by tuesday morning, an area totaling , square miles had been searched, the u.s. coast guard tweeted.the canadian research icebreaker polar prince, which was supporting the titan, was to continue conducting surface searches with help from a canadian boeing p poseidon reconnaissance aircraft, the coast guard said on twitter. two u.s. lockheed c hercules aircraft also conducted overflights.the canadian military dropped sonar buoys to listen for any possible sounds from the titan.concannon, who said he was supposed to be on the dive but could not go, said officials were also working to get a remotely operated vehicle that can dive to a depth of . miles ( kilometers) to the site as soon as possible.oceangate's expeditions to the titanic wreck site include archaeologists and marine biologists. the company also brings people who pay to come along, known as \"mission specialists.\" they take turns operating sonar equipment and performing other tasks in the submersible.the coast guard said monday that the titan carried a pilot and four \"mission specialists.\" however, oceangate's website suggests that the fifth person may be a so called \"content expert\" who guides the paying customers.authorities have yet to formally identify those on board, though some names have been confirmed, including oceangate ceo stockton rush, who, according to the company, was serving as a member of the crew.rush told the associated press in june that the titan's technology was \"very cutting edge\" and was developed with the help of nasa and aerospace manufacturers.\"this is the only submersible – crewed submersible – that's made of carbon fiber and titanium,\" rush said, calling it the \"largest carbon fiber structure that we know of,\" with inch thick carbon fiber and . inch thick titanium.a us coast guard vessel sits in port in boston harbor across from the us coast guard station boston in boston, massachusetts, on june , .joseph prezioso | afp | getty imagesharding, who lives in dubai in the united arab emirates, was one of the mission specialists, according to action aviation, a company where harding serves as chairman.harding is a billionaire adventurer who holds three guinness world records, including the longest duration at full ocean depth by a crewed vessel. in march , he and ocean explorer victor vescovo descended to the lowest depth of the mariana trench. in june , he went into space on blue origin's new shepard rocket.also on board were pakistani nationals shahzada dawood and his son suleman, according to a family statement. the dawoods belong to one of pakistan's most prominent families. their eponymous firm invests across the country in agriculture, industries and the health sector.shahzada dawood also is on the board of trustees for the california based seti institute that searches for extraterrestrial intelligence.french explorer and titanic expert paul henry nargeolet was also aboard, according to david gallo, a senior adviser for strategic initiatives and special projects at rms titanic. gallo identified nargeolet, a friend who has led multiple expeditions to the titanic, on tuesday during an interview with cnn.greg stone, a longtime ocean scientist based in california and a friend of rush, called the lost submersible \"a fundamentally new submarine design\" that showed great promise for future research. unlike its predecessors, the titan was not spherical in shape.\"stockton was a risk taker. he was smart ... he had a vision. he wanted to push things forward,\" stone said.the expedition was oceangate's third annual voyage to chronicle the deterioration of titanic, which struck an iceberg and sank in , killing all but about of the roughly , passengers and crew. since the wreckage's discovery in , it has been slowly succumbing to metal eating bacteria.oceangate's website described the \"mission support fee\" for the expedition as $ , a person.recalling his own trip aboard the titan, pogue said the vessel got turned around looking for the titanic.\"there's no gps underwater, so the surface ship is supposed to guide the sub to the shipwreck by sending text messages,\" pogue said in a segment aired on \"cbs sunday morning.\" \"but on this dive, communications somehow broke down. the sub never found the wreck.\" \n",

      "a passageway near the bank of england (boe) in the city of london, u.k., on thursday, march , .hollie adams | bloomberg | getty imageslondon — the bank of england on thursday surprised markets with a basis point hike to interest rates, its th consecutive increase as policymakers grapple with persistently high inflation.the monetary policy committee voted in favor of the half percentage point increase, which takes the bank's base rate to %. the move defied market expectations, which had priced in around a % chance of a basis point hike.sterling slipped against the dollar after the announcement while yields on u.k. government bonds — known as gilts — also retreated slightly. the yield on the year gilt was down by around basis points. yields move inversely to prices.fresh data on wednesday showed annual u.k. consumer price inflation was . % in may, unchanged from the previous month, cementing market expectations that the mpc would opt for another hike. economists also upped their expectations for further monetary tightening in the future.watch nowvideo : : bank of england surprises as it hikes rates to %squawk box europemost worryingly for the central bank, core inflation — which excludes volatile energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices — was . % year on year in may, up from . % in april and marking its highest rate since march .\"there has been significant upside news in recent data that indicates more persistence in the inflation process, against the background of a tight labour market and continued resilience in demand,\" the mpc said in its summary thursday.\"the mpc will continue to monitor closely indications of persistent inflationary pressures in the economy as a whole, including the tightness of labour market conditions and the behaviour of wage growth and services price inflation. if there were to be evidence of more persistent pressures, then further tightening in monetary policy would be required.\"policymakers are walking a tightrope as they attempt to tighten monetary policy sufficiently to quell inflationary pressures without triggering a full scale mortgage crisis and recession.the mpc said that the high number of fixed rate mortgages means that the full impact of the increase in the bank rate so far \"will not be felt for some time.\"since the end of , the bank has hiked its main rate from . % to %.\"the economy is doing better than expected, but inflation is still too high and we've got to deal with it,\" bank of england governor andrew bailey said in a statement thursday.\"we know this is hard — many people with mortgages or loans will be understandably worried about what this means for them. but if we don't raise rates now, it could be worse later.\"a 'hawkish super hike'although the market had partially priced in the larger increase, several analysts suggested that the size of the majority voting in favor of it implied a sense of urgency among mpc members.joseph little, global chief strategist at hsbc asset management, said the \"hawkish super hike\" comes at a critical juncture for the economy and signals policymakers' desire to \"get ahead of the curve.\"\"the u.k. finds itself in the worst position of major western economies. a cost of living crisis, brought about by rising energy and food prices, has been amplified by structural labour shortages, and has now metastasised into ratcheting wages,\" little said. \"inflation pressures show more persistency and more momentum than other western economies, and that forces the bank into a hawkish corner. today's statement has increased concerns of a much higher terminal policy rate, perhaps as high as %.\"although all developed economies endured a similar post covid pandemic deluge of inflationary pressures, u.k. headline inflation is decelerating at a much slower rate, while the core component is significantly higher than all other g nations and still accelerating.huw davies, investment manager at jupiter asset management, said thursday's move from the mpc was \"a tacit admission that they have been behind the curve in their hiking policy,\" and the rate rise represents \"an attempt to regain the initiative and their credibility.\"\"the key problem is that u.k. real rates have consistently been negative despite the tightening cycle. it feels like the boe will have to inflict more pain on u.k. households to achieve a return to a controlled level of inflation more in line with their inflation target,\" davies said. \n",

      "my relationship with wellness is more complicated than running into a guy i ghosted at an office party. i began my journey in as a lot of people do: dressed in lululemon and sipping green juice on my way to a yoga class. (i had chosen trap classes because i was much more comfortable hearing \"mouth full of golds\" during child's pose than risking stepping on a white woman's yoga mat.) soon, wellness became a capitalistic pursuit i held near. i loved grabbing a blue spirulina smoothie while out on a run — but only dressed in head to toe nike gear. lulu was for the gym and yoga. i became obsessed with rings, namely, closing the ones on my apple watch. \n",
      "by , after spending thousands of dollars on this journey without seeing any measurable improvement in my mental health — which people do experience from wellness efforts — i began to interrogate why i expected this effort to cure my anxiety and depression. i was sidelined by the coronavirus pandemic and, like many others, began to question what actually mattered to me. still, i did yoga, strength trained, cycled, and meditated at home to keep myself mentally afloat during the pandemic and during the antiracism protests over the murder of george floyd, an immensely triggering moment for black folks. having a routine was helpful until it wasn't. \n",
      "by , i was experiencing weekly panic attacks that slowly increased to i don't know how many days a week. i wasn't sleeping or moving much farther than from my bed to the couch. when i was eating, i wasn't choosing nutritious foods. i'd run out of motivation to care for myself — and all of it felt like it shouldn't be happening to me because i should be tougher. \n",
      "mainstream wellness was, to lean further into cliches, a band aid on a bullet wound. i was actively pursuing better mental and physical health, a key piece of a wellness journey, but i wasn't taking the time to establish what felt good to me. i was trying to fit into the trendiness of wellness, and i desperately wanted the freedom it proclaimed i could have if i bought enough stuff. nowadays, i define wellness as, \"doing what feels good and aligns with what i believe i need in this moment.\"\n",
      "my burnout story is a quintessential narrative among black women. many of us have been raised to be \"strong\" despite the systemic factors that make such an ideal impossible to uphold. the strong black woman trope demands that we swallow our pain for the greater good of others, and it comes with grave psychological consequences. it can make us more susceptible to depression, anxiety, and feelings of isolation. for some black women, we rarely forgive ourselves for our mistakes and relentlessly seek to meet others' expectations. this is more harrowing when we consider that stress compounds. besides causing headaches, chest pain, fatigue, and stomach issues, heightened stress levels can make sleeping impossible. your breathing can quicken. you could develop high blood pressure, a weakened immune system, anxiety, depression, type diabetes, or memory loss — adverse health outcomes that black people are more likely to experience. \n",
      "the systemic conditions that prevent black women from being able to take proper care of ourselves is one of our nation's most significant health injustices. and to add insult to our spiritual injury, wellness practices, which can be a useful tool to fight poor mental health, are presented to us through a eurocentric, capitalist lens, encouraging us to spend money many of us don't have on products we don't need to care for ourselves. \n",
      "i discussed these conditions and the role wellness plays in navigating them with deja love, the ceo of the black women's wellness agency. love's agency supports black women who are stressed, burnt out, and overwhelmed by connecting them to black women wellness providers. this could be a yoga teacher, meditation or life coach, personal trainer, or any non clinical wellness service that helps manage stress. \n",
      "\"we have to go deeper because the world in which we're living in, it's not sustainable for us to keep at this pace,\" love says. \"i really view this as a fierce urgency, as life or death. when black birthing persons are dying at three times the rates of white folks, that's a crisis. we are dying, across the board, at higher rates. this is why it's so important.\" \n",
      "this interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. \n",
      "explain your personal approach to wellness. is it more spiritual? or is it more political? \n",
      "for black women, our wellness is infinite. that it is not a $ yoga mat or yoga pants. since, especially in the mainstream context of the united states — which is incredibly racist with white supremacist undertones — wellness is generally capitalistic. it's about the doing, and the purchasing. \n",
      "infinite wellness is knowing that maybe wellness for me in one moment is sitting in silence, sensory deprivation, not on social, not logged in, but sitting, connecting to breath, connecting to the divine spirit that guides us, whatever folks identify with. in the context of america, wellness is rest. it's challenging a toxic grind culture that tells us we need to constantly produce, that we're not enough, that we're not doing enough. i'm guided by tricia hersey and her work. she leads the nap ministry, and her book rest is resistance has really shifted my paradigm and informs a lot of what i view as wellness.\n",
      "what are some of those white supremacist undertones to wellness? \n",
      "it's really this notion of, \"i have to do something. i have to purchase something. i have to buy something. i have to keep performing.\" and that can look like, \"i need to buy the expensive mask. i need to buy expensive face serums. i need to go to the gym classes.\" it's still a perpetuation of grind culture and hyper productivity. whereas the black woman's wellness agency and i challenge that and say, \"black women, you are enough by just being!\" it seems so simple, but the brilliance is in the simplicity of being — not doing. wellness is shifting our minds away from what we have been indoctrinated with, such as: \"i have to be a certain weight, i have to look a certain way, i have to have this.\" no. we have to be on the path of unlearning.\n",
      "those are some of the undertones. it's about this aesthetic, and that's what we get. but wellness is not an aesthetic. wellness is being connected to our breath, our bodies, and calming the mental fluctuations that happen constantly. \n",
      "this multibillion dollar wellness industry that says you have to drink this or take this supplement or be in this intricate yoga posture just creates more work. \n",
      "why isn't wellness binary for black women? i was looking on your website, and i saw that. i think i know what that means, but i'm very, very intrigued.\n",
      "it's not binary because we, as black women, are so robust. we have had to be. we've had to be the heads of households, to be cooks and cleaners, to raise children and make sure the finances are handled — we're constantly wearing so many hats. our healing and our wellness are not going to be boxed in. it can't be, because we have to do so much. \n",
      "black women are the largest demographic of advanced degree holders and business owners post . we're doing so much, and that's why we're proponents of wellness being whatever it is you need. \n",
      "if wellness is saying, \"i'm just really tired, and i don't need to push through,\" then that's wellness. if wellness is saying, \"my family is expecting me to do something, and i say i can't do that because i need to uphold my boundaries, and i can't keep pouring from this empty cup,\" then that's wellness. that's the journey that i'm still on. we're all still on it. \n",
      "it has to be full spectrum and incredibly inclusive. it has to counter the mainstream approach to wellness — the skinny white woman in lululemon doing an intricate yoga posture. that is not true wellness; that is a capitalistic approach that we have been fed, and we have to keep pushing back because that image may not serve us. now, we are not a monolith, so maybe that image serves some black women. i know for many, though, that it does not.\n",
      "one thing that i think most black women can all relate to is the pressure to fit into these spaces, whether it's work or a yoga studio, where you're the only black person there, and people are looking at you crazy. so when we reclaim and reframe wellness — meaning we stop looking at it through this billion dollar lens — how do we reconnect with our power? \n",
      "it's multifaceted. it will take many different approaches. one of them is going for a walk and doing a walking meditation, not having your airpods in, just listening to the sounds of nature so you can get out of your head and connect with the many thoughts that are going to come into your mind. i don't want to demonize social media. it's an amazing tool that connects us, but part of reclaiming is having healthy sabbaticals from social [media]. \n",
      "i'm also a proponent of therapy. therapy helps us be introspective. \n",
      "another thing that has helped me is being able to be free. business ownership has allowed me to feel free. i've had an year career in many business sectors, and within all of those sectors, you become indoctrinated, and your truth gets stifled by the dominant group. and even those who look like me can fall into assimilation and respectability. i speak unapologetically, and many people do not connect, and that's fine. i've had to make peace with the fact that i may not get all the business contracts, or i may not gross the revenue that i want. but i can sleep at night knowing that i am speaking for black women, that i am challenging inequities, the status quo, and a society that perpetuates it.\n",
      "you pointed out that when black women really start taking care of ourselves, prioritizing our needs, and start centering our well being, we lose people. it's always been very interesting to me that when a black woman starts thinking about her well being versus how she can be in service to everyone else, people start dropping off. \n",
      "earlier today, when i was on my walk, i was thinking about when we're on journeys of evolution. i don't want to be the same deja i was three years ago, a year ago. i want to be evolving, and learning, and there are folks that will not be there on that journey ... it's hard sometimes. it's always the folks you don't expect, the people who were always there. and that just hurts harder. part of that evolution is releasing that attachment. and the folks that connect to me will find me. i will build a new community. \n",
      "it's like my granny used to say, \"everybody can't come.\" speaking of her — a black woman who absolutely prioritized her well being after raising three generations of her family — how does wellness help black women thrive?\n",
      "it helps us because we are able to get reconnected with self. when i'm putting on my public health hat, our life expectancy is reduced in this white supremacist, very racist society. from medical racism in health care, housing, education, transportation — every facet that we intersect with has a huge impact on our outcome. every facet of being in this country challenges us. wellness helps us get back to our center when all of these forces that create the inequities we live in challenge us.\n",
      "sometimes we will question ourselves. we forget the confidence, the power, the self esteem, the self efficacy because we have been metaphorically beaten down by all of these systems.\n",
      "we even have to combat the complicity of folks in our own communities and other white adjacent folks of color. i know that's a provocative notion. black people and other folks of color can uphold white supremacy because we're all stewed in the same society. so people get surprised, for instance, that a black physician can perpetuate harm to their black patients. they have been trained in racist medical schools, so they can perpetuate what they have been taught. that's why wellness is so important. wellness is whatever a black woman needs. we know what we need for our healing, to feel grounded, to feel at peace, to feel centered. that is crucial as we navigate this society that we operate in.\n",
      "how does taking care of ourselves challenge hustle culture? sometimes this strikes me as a conundrum. we're trying to get out of this capitalistic dynamic of wellness, but we live in a capitalistic society, and we have to survive. and sometimes, for certain wellness practices, you have to buy something. it feels very sticky sometimes to see taking care of yourself as a challenge to capitalism when we live in a society where it's so deeply entrenched.\n",
      "it's so important because grind culture is insidious. we are not even aware of the hold that grind culture has on us. that's why stepping back transforms. \n",
      "again, i'm not immune from it. that's why i'm so intentional with my unlearning, even as a business owner, challenging myself to not just push through. i'll say: \"deja, you've been up for how many hours? you've been in how many back to back meetings? go out, take a walk, do a guided meditation, go do some yoga, just do something!\" \n",
      "i want to see a world where all black women, and i use that term inclusively, are well. where we're not burnt out, where we're not overwhelmed, where we're not stressed, where employers don't undervalue our contribution — they're not even paying us the full dollar! we're getting what? sixty seven cents on the dollar? and working twice as hard to prove ourselves. that is the encapsulation of grind culture and being unwell. \n",
      "julia craven is a writer covering anything she thinks is cool. she's the brain behind make it make sense, a wellness newsletter.\n",
      "will you support vox's explanatory journalism?\n",
      " most news outlets make their money through advertising or subscriptions. but when it comes to what we're trying to do at vox, there are a couple of big issues with relying on ads and subscriptions to keep the lights on.\n",
      "first, advertising dollars go up and down with the economy. we often only know a few months out what our advertising revenue will be, which makes it hard to plan ahead.\n",
      "second, we're not in the subscriptions business. vox is here to help everyone understand the complex issues shaping the world — not just the people who can afford to pay for a subscription. we believe that's an important part of building a more equal society. and we can't do that if we have a paywall. \n",
      "it's important that we have several ways we make money, just like it's important for you to have a diversified retirement portfolio to weather the ups and downs of the stock market. that's why, even though advertising is still our biggest source of revenue, we also seek grants and reader support. (and no matter how our work is funded, we have strict guidelines on editorial independence.)\n",

      "out of the millions of fungal species in the world, only a few hundred can make people sick. coccidioides is one of them — and it lives in desert dust. microscopic spores are kicked up when the ground is disturbed; if inhaled, they can cause an infection known as valley fever. most people recover without ever knowing they had it, but others will experience far more intense symptoms, ranging from pneumonia to meningitis. coccidioides is also really good at eating ... meat. \n",
      "fortunately, this fungus is typically only found in the southwestern us, parts of mexico, and central and south america — and cases are rare. but unfortunately, that range is expanding quickly. scientists are racing to understand exactly why, because even though this fungus has existed for millennia, there are still tons of unanswered questions about how it lives both in the desert and in people.\n",

      "the bear/fx\n",
      "alex abad santos\n",
      " is a senior correspondent who explains what society obsesses over, from marvel and movies to fitness and skin care. he came to vox in . prior to that, he worked at the atlantic.\n",
      "for a show incredibly concerned with the reality of restaurant kitchens — the heat, the stress, the yelling, the emotions — the bear is ultimately a fantasy, and that's all the more clear in season two. \n",
      "the first season, which found fiercely talented young chef carmen \"carmy\" berzatto (jeremy allen white) in his hometown of chicago running his recently deceased brother michael's (jon bernthal) sandwich shop, was sweaty, dirty, shouty, and as helen rosner wrote for the new yorker, something of a fairy tale. thanks to the gorgeously frenetic directing style that matches the show's substance, we followed along as carmy navigated everything from balancing a severely mismanaged budget to teaching a fine dining mentality to his skeptical crew (including his \"cousin\" richie (ebon moss bachrach)). after those trials, however, the season ended with a deus ex machina: before his suicide, michael had hidden hundreds of thousands of dollars in tomato cans, saving the shop and allowing his skilled younger brother to open the high end restaurant of his dreams. \n",
      "in its second season, the bear — also the name of the coming restaurant — is ready to tackle that challenge, and the show has unfurled into something bigger, better, more satisfying than its intricate collaboration of style and substance. if the first season poses the question of what an ambitious, dedicated, and inspired team can do with enough money, the second season has a touching answer: nurture their talent.\n",
      "early on, sydney (ayo edebiri), carmy's second in command, is in a rut. opening the restaurant that they want to open is all she's ever dreamed of. but the freedom comes with the duress of delivering a menu that's as good as they want it to be. for both chefs, but especially sydney, that means food that will earn a michelin star. she blows carmy's palate with food that's too salty; he throws it up into a paper towel. she tries again. he spits it out again. closer but not there. they need a reset, he declares. then he tells her to just go eat. she follows orders, making her way through chicago's best restaurants — starting with a breakfast sandwich at kasama (tagalog for togetherness) and visiting the city's lauded eateries like avec, margie's candies, pizza lobo, and publican quality meats) — before gathering her wits and attempting a ravioli dish.\n",
      "that moment when talent recognizes talent and calculates how to maximize their joint slay.\n",
      "the bear/fx\n",
      "she ends up hating what she made, but not before exemplifying the show's sly second season credo: a compassionate daydream where nothing is more important than nourishing the staff's gifts. from marcus's (lionel boyce) trip to copenhagen to richie's entry into the world of staging to the joy in tina (liza colon zayas)'s smile when syd makes her her sous chef, the bear never wavers from its conviction that talent and inspiration are precious. while there might be stress about exactly how much to spend on plates or how to pass the fire safety test, there's never a question about if it's worth it to make these people better at what they love to do. \n",
      "approaching the idea of (troubled) genius isn't foreign territory to the bear. the show has tackled it before, mainly in the context of how skill and aptitude go hand in hand with upward trajectory. carmy is so gifted that he finds freedom from his messy family life to work at one of the best restaurants in the country. his brilliance gives him escape, however briefly. carmy's talent is too big for the sandwich shop he inherits, and season one is about whether or not he can learn how to harness it into this mode of success.\n",
      "but this season, the show proves that talent is not strictly an individual endeavor. to grow as a person takes a community; a team effort. from sydney to marcus to tina to the famed chef terry (olivia colman in a glorious cameo), the throughline is that all these remarkable people need or needed people in their lives to nurture their gifts.\n",
      "that's evident in the episode \"honeydew,\" when carmy and sydney want marcus to up his pastry chef game. despite the increasing financial strain the restaurant is facing, they decide, without question, to send him on a trip to hone his desserts. the destination is copenhagen, where he'll sleep on the same houseboat and feed the invisible cat that carmy once did, and train under icy and talented pastry chef luca (will poulter), one of carmy's cohort. \n",
      "luca is firm but shows marcus how to create wildly punctilious desserts, like a scoop of ice cream so temperamental it needs to be caressed a certain way and a shiso gelee that ultimately ends up in a \"minty snickers bar.\" marcus's knack for picking up technique impresses luca enough that he tells marcus a story about a chef (who may or may not be carmy) so good that he forced luca into a bittersweet revelation. on the one hand, luca realized he'd never be the best, and on the other, this unnamed chef somehow unburdened him from the pressure he was putting on himself, allowing him to be the best he could be. luca found community in competition and realized that talent isn't a zero sum game where someone else's talent negates your own.\n",
      "there's room for everyone; talent inspires and fosters success, and marcus is part of that circle.\n",
      "similarly, the team sends tina to culinary school. again, cost doesn't even come into question. she thrives, relishing the opportunity to improve her skills. in the second season, initially guarded tina's hunger for self improvement is one of her defining characteristics, as is her fierce loyalty to carmy and syd. it makes the small moment in episode five, when carmy lets her bring his knife to culinary school, feel momentous. with carmy's confidence and tools, tina filets her culinary fish confidently, a determined look in her eye as the blade flips through the flesh. the cut is so good her instructor congratulates her. \n",
      "even if you're talented, you need someone to believe in you.\n",
      "my heart belongs to this episode.\n",
      "the bear/fx\n",
      "the best episode this season has richie staging a week at the best restaurant in the world in \"forks.\" richie begins by polishing forks. he hates every second of it, convinced this is all some exquisite and unusual punishment. it isn't until someone points out to richie that being able to change someone's day is truly wonderful, that it finally begins to click that he's watching extreme talent sharpened with extreme discipline.\n",
      "when he sees how the restaurant's servers communicate like soldiers speaking in secret code, detailing diners' stories, lives, eating habits, and allergies, he lights up. watching jess (sarah ramos) expedite, like a conductor telling their horn section to blow, thrills him. the once reluctant fork shiner is able to identify the restaurant's plethora of sauces in a blind taste test.\n",
      "he's high on success, on feeling like he's part of this team. richie wants to be the best version of himself. richie wants to work at this restaurant. but that's not how it all works.\n",
      "at the end of richie's week, he runs into chef terry (colman) cleaning mushrooms, a seemingly menial task. after peeling a couple of mushrooms himself, he takes a moment to apologize, thanking her for doing carmy a favor. she says that it actually wasn't a favor or a punishment, but that carmy told terry that he believes in richie and that he's naturally good at front of house. he doesn't let her see it, but it warms his heart. she also tells him that it's never too late to start over, that she crashed and burned and needed a reset too. \n",
      "a sign in her kitchen reads: \"every second counts.\"\n",
      "it's an homage from her to her late father, and a message that richie will never forget. terry's story also ties back, again, to the idea of how greatness needs a family or a community to survive. without her father, without her staff, without the people who helped her, she wouldn't be the most successful chef in the game.\n",
      "this idea that people who recognize talent should foster it and help it grow goes both ways. sydney, marcus, tina, richie, and even chef terry are lucky they've found someone who believes in them. if you want to grow as a person and hone your craft and what you love, you need to find someone who believes in you. it isn't a coincidence that carmy's biological family is portrayed as an acidic, toxic hindrance to his career, and that the one he's created for his team — via his network of chefs — is the literal opposite.\n",
      "of course, this is all a fantasy. \n",
      "bosses don't usually send their employees to scandinavia to nourish their souls and ignite their inspiration. a fantasy where our jobs make us better and recognize our brilliance and diligence is even more appealing as we're living in a reality suffering from burnout and the threat of ai replacement. the restaurant world — as the bear is keen to show us — is a different universe. and even then, the bear is more of an exceptional exception and not the norm. \n",
      "there's no guarantee that these characters will make good on their talent or that their talent will somehow lead to the success of carmy's restaurant. that's ultimately up to the fickleness of a cruel industry. but i can't help but hope that it does. \n",
      "all episodes of the bear season two are streaming on hulu.\n",

      "kamil krzaczynski/afp via getty images\n",
      "rebecca leber\n",
      " is a senior reporter covering climate change for vox. she was previously an environmental reporter at mother jones, grist, and the new republic. rebecca also serves on the board of the society of environmental journalists.\n",
      "it's not enough to trust the senses to know when it's a bad air day. well before you can see or smell smoke, it can start wreaking havoc on the lungs. \n",
      "that haze you can see and smell on a particularly polluted day is made of ozone and fine particulate matter. \n",
      "fine particulate matter, known as pm . (the . microns describes its size, times smaller than the width of a human hair) can embed in the cells of the lung and the bloodstream, aggravating inflammation, asthma, heart disease, and mental health. and ozone causes similar damage. in the stratosphere, ozone blocks ultraviolet radiation from the sun, but at ground level it can cause shortness of breath and damage to respiratory tissue. \n",
      "both pollutants can affect the entire body in all stages of life: young and old, and even the developing fetus. they come from sources as varied as the tailpipe of a truck, your neighbor's barbecue, coal plant, or an incinerator. pm . is capable of traveling thousands of miles across the world on the wind — taking, for instance, about five days to reach the us from china. \n",

      "why canada's wildfires will affect air quality for weeks to come\n",
      "the dose makes the poison; there is a difference between moderately bad air and really bad air. public health experts recommend monitoring changes in air quality as often as you check the weather. but you should also know some basic facts to help you determine your own sensitivity to air pollution and the appropriate action to take. \n",
      "what is the air quality index?\n",
      "the air quality index, set by the environmental protection agency, is your guide to how bad the air quality is outdoors. the data that goes into the air quality index comes from , air monitors across the country, including local, state, tribal, and federal reporting. \n",
      "there are actually two aqis for air quality, one for particulate matter and one for ozone, but when you see just one aqi, you're looking at whatever pollutant is the higher of the two. \n",
      "you can find the latest aqi on the epa's airnow website or by downloading its airnow app. weather apps are often using propriety data from a company called breezometer to determine aqi and forecasts. these numbers are based on epa monitoring but may not be identical to the epa's aqi, though they should be in the same ballpark. outside the us, air pollution monitoring can vary widely depending on the country, so aqis reported around the world may also be pulling from a mix of computer modeling and satellite data.\n",
      "there are some important drawbacks to the aqi. it tries to distill a lot of information into one datapoint, and it depends on air monitors often placed near cities and not close to industrial polluters. since air pollution can vary widely even over short distances — think a busy highway versus a quiet, tree lined road — the air could be worse if you're near a pollution source. communities of color are systematically exposed to more pollution from industrial sources and transportation, and the aqi doesn't do a good job capturing that disparity. \n",
      "thousands of air quality monitors pull data from around the country to calculate the air quality index. while the monitoring captures an accurate high level view of pollution levels, it doesn't capture pollution that can vary widely block to block.\n",
      "hyoung chang/denver post via getty images\n",
      "who really needs to pay attention to the aqi?\n",
      "ideally, everyone should monitor the aqi. epa experts liken it to understanding the weather. \n",
      "people have different sensitivities to air pollutants, just as people can have different temperatures they're comfortable at. they can even be more uncomfortable with one type of pollutant than another.\n",
      "but the epa breaks out its recommendations for a general population group and a sensitive population. the sensitive group is actually quite large. if you have asthma or copd, you fall in this category, but so do young children (under age ), older adults (over ), and pregnant people. \n",
      "\"the younger the child is, the faster their breathing, and so pound for pound, they are breathing more air pollution,\" said lisa patel, a stanford professor of pediatrics and an executive director of the medical society consortium on climate and health. \"we use as a cut off for particular vulnerabilities because age is a period of really rapid lung growth. and so exposure to those toxins so early is particularly concerning, but it's also concerning across the entire spectrum of ages.\"\n",
      " related\n",
      "smoky air puts everyone at risk — but it's worse for some\n",
      "even if you don't fall into one of the sensitive categories, an epa official explained that the public should still \"know their number.\" the aqi is based on large population studies, so it doesn't necessarily help you understand your individual risk. by monitoring the aqi regularly and paying close attention to any symptoms, you can get a feel for the level at which you should take proactive action.\n",

      "the epa breaks the air quality index into a few categories with different recommendations. \n",
      "green ( – ): the air is safe to breathe.\n",
      "yellow ( – ): the air quality is considered moderate, except for the most sensitive groups.\n",
      "orange ( – ): sensitive groups should reduce heavy exertion outside or take more breaks, and people with asthma and heart disease should watch for symptoms. the rest of the population may be fine.\n",
      "red ( – ): the air is unhealthy for everyone. sensitive groups should avoid being active outdoors, while everyone else should reduce their time outdoors.\n",
      "purple ( – ): the air is very unhealthy for everyone. everyone should consider moving their activities inside.\n",
      "maroon ( and above): this is the highest level — hazardous — and anyone can be at risk. everyone should avoid physical activity outdoors, and if you're sensitive, you should remain indoors.\n",
      "doctors and public health experts urge people to monitor any symptoms as pollution levels climb, especially once the aqi is in the orange and red range. \n",
      "the symptoms to watch can vary. a surefire sign to take it easy (limiting activity outdoors and potentially seeking medical help) is shortness of breath. coughing, discomfort, and tightness of the chest can all signal issues with breathing. \n",
      "other symptoms could be less obvious, throat irritation, fatigue, a stuffy nose or a headache. an epa expert explained she feels a side stitch when exercising on a bad air day. \n",
      "in infants, patel suggests to look out for grunting noises, bobbing heads, and using chest muscles to breathe as warning signs. kids who have asthma should have an asthma action plan set with a health provider on using an inhaler.\n",
      "it's important to pay attention to these symptoms in both adults and children while regularly checking the aqi level at which you start to feel discomfort. starting this now will help you in the future when you need to decide what precautions to take and when.\n",
      "what are the precautions i should take outdoors, and when should i take action? \n",
      "the aqi is most confusing when it falls into the yellow, orange, and red ranges. \n",
      "if you are sensitive to air pollution, then you want to reduce your exercise and heavy exertion outside once the aqi hits orange. the entire population should start taking precautions when it is in the red territory. you might even want to reconsider spending extensive time outside at these higher levels, and don an n or kn mask if you do need to be outside (cloth masks will not protect you from pm . ).\n",
      "it helps to think about reduction in terms of dosage. you can cut your time outside, your exertion level, or both. if you reduce a minute walk to minutes, you're cutting your exposure to the pollution by half. if you sit on your porch instead of going for a walk or run, you're also cutting down how much pollution you inhale.\n",
      "when is air pollution at its worse?\n",
      "the time of year, and even the time of day, can matter immensely for air quality. \n",
      "ozone is typically at its worst in warmer months, between april and october in the us. it needs sunlight to trigger its chemical reactions, so late afternoons and early evenings can be smoggier than the mornings. emissions that come from the tailpipes of cars and burning fossil fuels interact to form ozone that can build up to dangerous concentrations depending on geography and weather patterns. \n",
      "particulate matter's worst months are usually peak wildfire season, so late summer and fall. again, though, there are no strict rules here. wildfires are no longer contained to predictable seasons due largely to climate change, as the east coast experienced when canadian wildfires caused smoggy extremes in early june. other sources of pm . include barbecues and fireworks, making july fourth and the days that follow worse for air quality. \n",
      "tracey holloway, an atmospheric scientist at the university of wisconsin madison who works with nasa, also explained that, unlike ozone, pm . \"comes in different flavors.\" she explained, \"there are some situations where pm . is highest at night because it's trapped [an inversion where the ground is cooler], and there's some situations where pm . is highest in the middle of the day because it's cooked up by the sun.\"\n",
      "though experts focus mostly on the two main pollutants of concern in air pollution, pm . and ozone, there are other substances that can hitch a ride with this pollution. patel, the pediatrician, said wildfire smoke is especially toxic. burning trees can release more mercury in the air because of how the pollutant has settled on surfaces. and when fires hit houses and towns, they burn up plastics and petrochemicals, releasing more carcinogenic and metallic substances into the atmosphere.\n",
      "one tip is to not dose yourself unnecessarily with pollution when air quality is bad. a hazardous air day is a poor time to fire up the barbecue or gas stove. you could swap out the gas appliance entirely for an induction burner.\n",
      "patrick t. fallon/afp via getty images\n",
      "should i be concerned indoors?\n",
      "staying indoors helps, but there are some additional actions to consider. \n",
      "if you have central air conditioning or can access a building with air conditioning, that helps filter out pollutants. also, hepa air filters cut down on particulate matter and don't have to cost a lot. the university of washington has a manual for building your own low cost air filter for roughly $ , which can dramatically lower fine particles. \n",
      " related\n",
      "how to make your indoor air better when it's smoky outside\n",
      "since you're getting a hefty dose of air pollution from the outdoors, it's even more important not to expose yourself unnecessarily inside. former director of the center for climate, health, and the global environment at harvard t.h. chan school of public health and pediatrician aaron bernstein said people do this in ways they don't realize. they might idle their cars in attached garages, or use fragranced and ozone forming products, or run woodor gas burning stoves and fireplaces that pollute indoor air.\n",
      "what can my community do to reduce air pollution?\n",
      "the no. action we can take for better air is addressing the root cause, not just the symptoms. after all, not everyone has control over their outdoor activities, and some communities and outdoor workers face astronomically higher risk from pollution than others. white americans contribute more to air pollution through their consumption of goods and services, yet black and hispanic americans tend to live in neighborhoods with lower air quality. \n",
      "one of the challenges in tackling climate change is that the carbon we're releasing now will stick around in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. that's fortunately not the case with particulate matter and ozone. they settle in a matter of days, so air can clear almost immediately once we address the sources of pollution. the world experienced how fast the air can improve when road and air travel came to sudden standstill early in the covid pandemic. \n",
      "\"a lot of air pollution comes from controllable sources,\" holloway said. \"when we implement changes to our transportation, industries, energy systems, and roadways, all of those can immediately improve our air quality. certainly, we can't just make a policy change and have wildfires go away. but for many other sources of air pollution, there are a lot of available technologies to make the air cleaner.\"\n",
      "despite worsening wildfires, air quality has on the whole grown cleaner, especially within the united states over the last years, as states have reduced major industrial sources of smog. environmental regulations have worked as intended to clean up the worst polluters. \n",
      "\"we have already made huge improvements in having cleaner vehicles and trucks, cleaner power plants, and cleaner industrial facilities,\" said holloway. \"and these have been deliberate choices that we've made.\" holloway believes \"this isn't a hopeless situation\" as long as society moves to tackling the sources of the problem.\n",
      "what other resources are out there?\n",
      "the basic resources everyone should know about: the epa airnow website and airnow app. these have information you need about the aqi level and the forecast.\n",
      "the epa fire and smoke map has much more detailed information by zip code on pm . coming from wildfires, drawing from a larger range of sources than the basic aqi.\n",
      "the epa's guidance for schools.\n",
      "the centers for disease control and prevention's guidance on what to do to protect yourself from wildfire smoke, broken down by vulnerable groups.\n",
      "the epa also tracks pollution sources across a broad range in its ejscreen map. propublica launched its own impressive database of cancer causing air pollution by zip code across the us. \n",
      "a resource for monitoring air quality around the world. \n",

      "the summer solstice is upon us: wednesday, june , is the longest day of , and the start of the summer season, for anyone living north of the equator. \n",
      "technically speaking, the summer solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the tropic of cancer, or . degrees north latitude. this will occur at exactly : am eastern wednesday. if you're a fan of sunlight, wearing shorts, eating ice cream, and enjoying all summer has to offer, this is likely a big day for you.\n",
      "below is a short scientific guide to the longest day of the year. \n",
      " ) why do we have a summer solstice, anyway?\n",
      "the summer and winter solstices, the seasons, and the changing length of daylight hours throughout the year are all due to one fact: earth spins on a tilted axis. \n",
      "the tilt — possibly caused by a massive object hitting earth billions of years ago — means that for half the year, the north pole is pointed toward the sun (as in the picture below). for the other half of the year, the south pole gets more light. \n",
      "nasa\n",
      "here's a time lapse demonstration of the phenomenon shot over the course of a whole year from space. in the video, you can see how the line separating day from night (called the terminator) swings back and forth from the poles during the year. \n",
      "nasa/meteosat/robert simmon\n",
      "a fun fact about the terminator: it's not the case that it splits the earth into even halves of light and dark. that's because our atmosphere bends sunlight a bit, essentially stretching it over a slightly greater area of land. this \"results in the land covered by sunlight having greater area than the land covered by darkness,\" the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa) explains. \n",
      " ) how many hours of sunlight will i get on the st?\n",
      "that depends on where you live. the farther north you are, the more sunlight you'll see during the solstice. alaska based climatologist brian brettschneider created this terrific guide (click to see some charts): the northernmost latitudes will see an entire hours of sunlight, while most of the us will see anywhere between and hours.\n",
      "hours of daylight on the summer solstice. pic.twitter.com/o f v ngu — brian brettschneider (@climatologist ) june , \n",
      "on the chance you live near the arctic circle, the sun never really sets during the solstice. \n",
      "here's another cool way to visualize the extreme of the summer solstice. in , a resident of alberta, canada — several hundred miles south of fairbanks but still in a high latitude — took this pinhole camera photograph of the sun's path throughout the year and shared it with the astronomy website earthsky. you can see the dramatic change in the arc of the sun from december to june. (you can easily make a similar image at home. all you need is a can, photo paper, some tape, and a pin. instructions here.)\n",
      "this is a month pinhole photo taken from solstice to solstice, in medicine hat, alberta, canada. we are one of the sunniest cities in canada, and this shows it nicely.posted by ian hennes on saturday, december , \n",
      " ) is the solstice the latest sunset of the year?\n",
      "not necessarily. just because june is the longest day of the year for the northern hemisphere doesn't mean every location has its earliest sunrise or latest sunset on that day.\n",
      "if you live in washington, dc, the latest sunsets will start the day after the solstice, the nd. if you like sleeping in, that's arguably the most exciting day of the summer. timeanddate.com can tell you when the latest sunset will occur in your area. \n",
      " ) is the solstice really the first day of summer?\n",
      "well, depends: are you asking a meteorologist or an astronomer?\n",
      "meteorologically speaking, summer is defined as the hottest three months of the year, winter is the coldest three months, and the in between months are spring and fall.\n",
      "here's how noaa breaks it down:\n",
      "meteorological spring includes march, april, and may; meteorological summer includes june, july, and august; meteorological fall includes september, october, and november; and meteorological winter includes december, january, and february.\n",
      "so by this meteorological definition, summer has already started. but astronomically speaking, yes, summer begins when the sun is directly over the tropic of cancer, which is on the solstice. \n",
      " ) do i need to wear sunscreen? \n",
      "yes, you should wear sunscreen in the intense summer sun. though, as vox's julia belluz has reported, the research on whether sunscreen actually helps prevent the more aggressive form of skin cancer is lacking. as she writes:\n",
      "the us preventive services task force summed up the evidence on the health effects of sunscreen use ... [and] found that sunscreen reduced the incidence of squamous cell cancer, but that it had no effect on basal cell cancer. what's more, \"there are no direct data about the effect of sunscreen on melanoma incidence.\"\n",
      "still, research is always evolving and newer studies are emerging that show sunscreen can curb melanoma risk, such as this long term trial from australia.\n",
      "that said, it does definitely help prevent sunburn, which is unpleasant. for more on the science of sunscreen, read belluz's explainer.\n",
      " ) are there solstices and equinoxes on other planets? \n",
      "yes! all the planets in our solar system rotate on a tilted axis and therefore have seasons. some of these tilts are minor (like mercury, which is tilted at . degrees). but others are more like earth ( . degrees) or are even more extreme (uranus is tilted degrees!). \n",
      "below, see a beautiful composite image of saturn on its equinox captured by the cassini spacecraft (rip) in . the gas giant is tilted degrees relative to the sun, and equinoxes on the planet are less frequent than on earth. saturn only sees an equinox about once every years (because it takes saturn years to complete one orbit around the sun).\n",
      "cassini imaging team/nasa\n",
      "during saturn's equinox, its rings become unusually dark. that's because these rings are only around feet thick, and when light hits them head on, there's not much surface area to reflect. \n",

      "flanked by a traditional buffalo grass doll and sipping a diet coke, teehee traces the long thread of us federal action that shaped the next chapter of her story: federal action brought her family to a nearby town that has been marked by poverty and poor health. a federal program to assimilate native american children took her parents to a boarding school, and another sought to urbanize them with work in chicago. federal dollars would fund the preschool she attended and the hospital where her parents built careers.\n",
      "cherokee people and their tribal government, teehee believes, should have always had a seat at the table where these decisions were made: the very treaty that saw her ancestors forced off their lands almost years ago also promised cherokee people a non voting delegate seat in the us house. now, the cherokee nation and teehee — who was appointed to the job by the tribe's leaders — are mounting an aggressive campaign to see that promise fulfilled.\n",
      "the cherokee nation's efforts to sit teehee in the house have bipartisan support, but it's not immediately clear when or how congressional leaders will take up the issue in earnest. if she gets this seat, with spots on key panels and the power to speak on the house floor, teehee hopes to help shape the next chapter of federal policy to benefit tribal governments and the people they serve. that includes addressing the epidemic of violence against native women, saving the cherokee language from extinction, and protecting funding for health care and housing.\n",
      "\"as a foundational matter in my life story, it's important to appreciate that so much of federal indian law and policy in this country has so directly impacted my family, personal story, and my journey,\" teehee said. \"i didn't see it as a young girl, but much later i could appreciate it all.\" \n",
      "the cherokee nation is the country's most populous tribe, with , citizens. teehee's seat in congress would mark the beginning of a new kind of relationship between the federal government and the cherokee nation, along with the tribal governments of the other federally recognized tribes. that the first delegate from the cherokee nation would be a woman in a men dominated chamber would also send a public message about the tribe's values. \n",
      "\"we are matrilineal people. it informs a lot about how we care for our families and empower all generations of women to lead,\" taralee montgomery, a senior policy adviser for the cherokee nation told the th. \"the fact that the first delegate to be seated is a woman — that's obvious to cherokee culture.\"\n",
      "montgomery, , has worked alongside teehee for six years and described her as an \"absolute force.\" montgomery had just unveiled a new room designed to accommodate breastfeeding parents who work at the cherokee nation's offices in the tribe's capital of tahlequah or visit the building for government services, part of the tribe's efforts to make its government more family friendly. she credited teehee with empowering her to pursue the project. \"she means so much to young people like me,\" montgomery added. \n",
      "montgomery said that until recently, many cherokee people didn't know about the provision of the treaty of new echota promising a cherokee delegate. since the campaign to seat teehee kicked off last fall, interest in seeing the treaty fulfilled has been building among cherokee people.\n",
      "\"the thing about kim teehee is that she will never meet a challenge that she won't take on and conquer,\" montgomery said. \"that tells you a lot about her role as a delegate.\" \n",
      "the durbin feeling language center, which opened last year, is housed in what used to be an old casino on the southern end of tahlequah. the immersive space, used to teach the cherokee language to children and adults, exudes joy, but also urgency. in , cherokee people declared their language to be under a state of emergency, headed for extinction. \n",
      "of about , cherokee people living in the united states, a survey found that just over , can speak cherokee fluently. most of those speakers are over the age of , and every year, there are fewer. just families are estimated to speak cherokee at home. \n",
      "teehee doesn't speak much cherokee, though her parents both grew up speaking it almost exclusively at home in the land allotments assigned to their families by the federal government near stilwell, oklahoma, about minutes outside tahlequah. on the grounds of the salem baptist church in stilwell, rows of headstones mark the graves of teehee's family members. \n",
      "why teehee is not fluent in cherokee can be traced back to federal policy — more specifically, a program that sought to urbanize native americans with the promise of work opportunities far from their reservations. the federal dollars that helped fund the durbin feeling language center are the beginning of the effort to repair the harms from that policy, and it's personal for teehee. \n",
      "teehee's parents met at sequoyah high school, which at the time was a us bureau of indian affairs boarding school. they weren't prohibited from speaking cherokee — a rule at many such schools — but it wasn't useful in communicating with students who hailed from different tribes from across the region. \n",
      "teehee's dad eventually dropped out to enroll in a federal work relocation program that took him to chicago, where teehee was born and spent the first decade of her life. \n",
      "\"the idea was to relocate you to find new opportunities. its intent, though, from congress, was to assimilate you into mainstream society,\" teehee said. \"there's a saying that has its origins in the indian boarding school era, which is, 'kill the indian, save the man.'\"\n",
      "chicago became one of the largest hubs of relocated indigenous americans in the united states. teehee grew up understanding she was cherokee, but the opportunity for work in chicago afforded to her parents meant the loss of formative years in her own cherokee community. through his job, teehee's dad was able to complete his high school diploma, which helped pave the way for a trade job back home in oklahoma, where the family yearned to be.\n",
      "many of those at the durbin feeling language center have similar family stories: they didn't grow up speaking the language at home but want to learn now; they want their own children to grow up fluent. \n",
      "kristen thomas, who leads a program that pairs native cherokee speakers with hopeful students, notes that the building itself is an immersive experience in the cherokee language. every sign and every book inside the , square foot facility — from the label on the fire extinguisher to a storybook about the solar system — is written in cherokee to serve its preschool through eighth grade language immersion school and its adult apprentice program. when its day care center opens later this year, the babies too will hear only cherokee. \n",
      "the school's main purpose is to create new cherokee speakers, but it is also a hub to foster pride in cherokee culture. inside the school's gym, there is a stack of wooden sticks with loops on one end used to play stickball, a sport played by several north american indigenous tribes that was the precursor to lacrosse. another space holds a demonstration kitchen to preserve traditional cherokee recipes, like ꮢꭹ & ꮷꮺꮵ, a dish made up of wild onions prepared with eggs and animal fat.\n",
      "the center was made possible by a combination of cherokee nation funds and federal dollars. earlier this year, president joe biden signed a law that funds a federal survey of both native language use and the funding needs of language revitalization efforts. it shares its namesake with the center: durbin feeling was the cherokee linguist who helped add the cherokee syllabary to word processing technology.\n",
      "thomas said that federal support for cherokee language revitalization efforts is crucial, given that language is \"the lens through which we view the world.\" she described teehee as an obvious choice to represent cherokee people in congress and urged house lawmakers to take action. \n",
      "\"there's that we deserve it, and that we've been promised this,\" thomas said. \"but even without that, this is such an obvious placement and way to strengthen the partnership with indian country.\" \n",
      "teehee said the effort to protect native american languages would be one of her priorities as the seated cherokee delegate to congress. the cherokee nation believes that federal support to protect the language would help directly address its own damage to native american language and culture. \n",
      "\"i always say i'm a product of federal indian policy and relocation, getting us to another state where acculturation was the goal,\" teehee said. \"but i'm also a product of its failure because the program highly underestimated the attachments that indians have toward their communities and our families.\" \n",
      "while in college, teehee joined the cherokee nation's government office to work as an intern under wilma mankiller, the first woman elected as principal chief of the cherokee nation.\n",
      "mankiller, who died in , became teehee's longtime mentor. teehee described mankiller as an exacting boss who nevertheless taught her to be patient when listening to people's struggles and to welcome them with empathy. \n",
      "in , mankiller had become just the third chief elected to the role since cherokee people regained the power to elect their own chiefs in the s. during her tenure, mankiller reshaped the tribe's relationship with the federal government to protect its sovereignty, and focused on health care and women's leadership.\n",
      "mankiller, in a speech at emory university, told a story about an encounter between cherokee people and a united states treaty negotiation team. the us cadre was made up of men, prompting the cherokees to ask, \"where are your women?\" \n",
      "teehee had been set on going to medical school, but mankiller urged her to attend law school. afterward, teehee felt pulled to a career advocating for the power and sovereignty of the cherokee nation and its people. she decided washington, dc, was the place to do it after hearing one of the tribe's lobbyists describe quashing what they considered anti indian legislation in congress.\n",
      "in , after a decade working on native american issues in dc, teehee would be tapped for her highest profile job to date as the nation's first ever senior policy adviser for native american affairs under the administration of president barack obama. in that role, she pushed for legislation that would strengthen accountability for people who commit crimes against native american women.\n",
      "more than four in five american indian and alaska native women — . percent — have experienced violence in their lifetime; more than half have experienced sexual violence, according to a federal study. murder is the third leading cause of death for native american women. \n",
      "advocates have long criticized federal and state law enforcement agencies for not doing enough to respond to missing person reports and reports of violence related to native american women and girls.\n",
      "the national indigenous women's resource center blames the high incidence of violence against indigenous women on the erosion of tribal sovereignty and a complicated justice system facing victims and their families that has allowed perpetrators to move on without facing accountability. \n",
      "\"in the s and ' s, as tribes are starting to grow more economically, and creating more jobs, and creating resorts and casinos, and hotels and golf courses, that's inviting more non indians on the reservation. when you don't have criminal jurisdiction over that non indian, that's an enormous gap,\" teehee said. \n",
      "\"and then when you combine that with the fact that, you know, probably about half of native american women are married to non native spouses, you leave an environment that's vulnerable for the rates that we have of domestic violence in indian country.\" \n",
      "a tool to combat those astounding rates of violence was included in the reauthorization of the violence against women act. it gave tribal governments power to prosecute non indigenous people who commit domestic violence or dating violence against indigenous women in indian country.\n",
      "teehee said the measure found a receptive ear in congress in part thanks to her years of relationship building and education on native american issues with lawmakers and congressional staff.\n",
      "after a stint at the democratic national committee helping the party navigate its relationship with native american tribes and advocacy groups, teehee pivoted to congress in , becoming a senior adviser and the sole staffer for the first native american caucus in the house. \n",
      "the caucus worked to educate members on indian issues, \"as well as try to kill anti indian proposals,\" teehee said. often, positions that weren't favorable to native american tribes came from lack of information about how proposals would impact them.\n",
      "\"i felt that that was my job to fill gaps,\" teehee said. \"if you don't have time to get to know an issue, you can't write about it for your boss, i will do it. and i don't need credit for it. i'll give you a letter. i'll give you a memo. i'll set up meetings for you. i'll give you backgrounders.\" \n",
      "when the time came for negotiations surrounding the violence against women act and the provisions dealing with tribal jurisdiction in , teehee said, the administration had a congress that was really informed and supportive of issues impacting native american people. \n",
      "\"if we don't do it now, we're going to lose that learning curve,\" teehee told the administration at the time. \n",
      "while she's not a seated delegate in congress, teehee has continued advocating on behalf of the cherokee nation in congress and before the white house. last year, biden signed a reauthorization of the same law that expanded the list of crimes over which tribal governments have jurisdiction to include sexual violence, sex trafficking, and stalking. \n",
      "it's ongoing work. teehee said that the list of issues impacting tribal governments is long and the list of champions in congress is ever fluctuating. the next battle for tribal governments will be to secure funding for their most basic operations. about percent of all federal funding that flows to tribal governments is discretionary and subject to constant reauthorization. teehee has been advocating for that funding to become a permanent expenditure out of reach of politicking or a government shutdown. \n",
      "\"that's education, that's housing, that's food,\" teehee said. \n",
      "set back from a busy commercial street by a lush green lawn in the heart of tahlequah sits an ornate two story brick building. this structure replaced a wooden one that burned down during the civil war and was finished in — years after the forced relocation of cherokee people to this land — and became the capitol of the cherokee nation. in the s, when oklahoma became a state and the federal government sought to dissolve the tribal governments, the cherokee legislative body lost its power and the building became the property of the local county government. cherokee people wouldn't elect their own chief for another years. \n",
      "one question that comes up often in discussions about seating a cherokee nation delegate in congress is why it took nearly years for the tribal government to name someone to the post and move to formally seat them in washington. \n",
      "\"when we get to our new homeland, we are simply trying to survive and rebuild a great society,\" said chuck hoskin, the principal chief of the cherokee nation. like the old capitol, now the cherokee history museum, cherokee people would go through periods of destruction and disempowerment for the next years. \n",
      "in the s, when cherokee people elected their first principal chief and the federal government gave the tribe more financial autonomy, hoskin said a period of rebuilding began that led to the moment the tribe finds itself in now — where it has the political connections and resources to demand its seat in congress. \n",
      "hoskin, who was reelected to the job this year, oversees the tribe's government.\n",
      "those efforts appeared on the brink of success at the end of last year, following a months long public campaign to pressure the united states to fulfill its treaty obligation, including intense lobbying of congressional leaders and dozens of interviews with the press. the campaign gained momentum from a congressional hearing in november, where lawmakers of both parties acknowledged the treaty and expressed support for exploring different avenues to seat teehee. support rose to the highest ranks when then house speaker nancy pelosi committed to finding a \"path\" to welcome a cherokee nation delegate into the house.\n",
      "republican rep. tom cole of oklahoma, who now chairs the panel handling this issue, the rules committee, called teehee \"a very good friend\" during the hearing. cole's office did not respond to a about when his committee may take up the issue again.\n",
      "an aide to rep. jim mcgovern, the highest ranking democrat on the panel, who spearheaded the november hearing, said mcgovern continues to believe that a cherokee nation delegate should be seated in the house and reaffirmed the lawmaker's commitment to advocating for the issue.\n",
      "the aide said mcgovern was frustrated that the issue didn't advance in the th congress.\n",
      "into december, teehee and the cherokee nation's leaders held onto hope that democratic leaders would act on the issue before their time in the majority ran out. they did not. \n",
      "the house's new gop majority meant the cherokee nation's delegate campaign had to start over in the work of educating lawmakers. they also needed to address outstanding concerns, which boil down to four critical questions.\n",
      "the first and most consequential is whether seating the cherokee delegate can be done with a simple house resolution, or if the process will require approval from the senate and the president — a lengthier and more politically involved process.\n",
      "second, some lawmakers have wondered whether congress should have a delegate who is appointed. the house's delegates representing us territories are elected, but teehee was appointed by the cherokee nation's tribal government. (the cherokee nation says it's within its sovereign rights to decide how it picks its own representative.)\n",
      "the third is whether sitting teehee would give double representation in congress to cherokee people, who are already technically represented by whoever their local representative is. \n",
      "lastly, congress would also need to decide how to handle the claims made by other cherokee bands to the delegate seat. on the side of tahlequah's main artery, a large ad on a bright electronic billboard shows a cherokee woman alongside a plea to congress to seat a cherokee delegate. but the woman is not kim teehee — it's tori holland of the united keetoowah band of cherokee indians of oklahoma, which has its own treaty claim to a delegate seat in congress. there may be another. \n",
      "all are questions that cherokee nation lawyers and congress's research arm have studied.\n",
      "\"it's an enormous undertaking to educate again,\" teehee said. \"i feel like i'm back at being that staffer that used to research, write memos, write letters, write colloquies, figure out how to message to d's and to r's. you know, i'm back in that space again. \"\n",
      "just outside the lawn of the cherokee history museum in a busy part of tahlequah is a sitting area and art installation lush with lavender and ornamental grass. tall murals feature the work of traci rabbit, a cherokee artist who says her work tries to capture the essence of the native american woman: \"from the proud lift of her chin to the strands of hair caught in the wind, she appears to weather all storms.\" \n",
      "it's sunny, the bright colors of the murals are popping, and the women in them seem to float above the ground. the mural behind where teehee sits for our interview is called \"cherokee traditions\" and shows a woman wearing a traditional feather cape; only a handful of cherokee artists who can make them are left.\n",
      "if her bid to be seated as the delegate from the cherokee nation to congress comes to fruition, teehee said, the moment will be bittersweet: the cost was the home, lives, and tears of her ancestors. hundreds of thousands of cherokees never saw the promise fulfilled. \n",
      "\"i feel it now just talking about it — you know, how proud i am to represent my nation. but then i can't help but think about what we lost in the process, too,\" teehee said. \n",
      "if she gets to take the oath of office, teehee will place her hand on her own bible, written in the cherokee language. her first choice would have been one of her grandfather's old cherokee bibles, but so many of the family's documents and books burned to ash in a house fire — including a little green cherokee hymn book cherished by her dad. the sound of cherokee hymns reminds teehee of traveling to her parents' home for family funerals. \n",
      "her parents are now in their late s and suffering from serious illnesses. teehee said they continue to be a key source of motivation for her work. \n",
      "\"i think of how proud i would be for my parents to be able to be there with me and to be alive to see it as cherokee speakers. i just hope it does happen in their lifetime.\"\n",

      "correction, june , : am: an earlier version of this article misspelled the name and affiliation of the school teehee's parents attended. it was sequoyah high school, and the boarding school was run by the us bureau of indian affairs. the article also misstated the type of federal dollars used to fund the durbin feeling language center; it is us bureau of indian affairs child care dollars.\n",

      " most news outlets make their money through advertising or subscriptions. but when it comes to what we're trying to do at vox, there are a couple of big issues with relying on ads and subscriptions to keep the lights on.\n",

      "scorpions are masters of the long game who are willing to harm themselves if it means getting even with an enemy. apropos of this, they are represented by an animal that would rather sting itself to death than accept defeat. spiteful to the last, malachy mccourt's famous words of caution, \"resentment is like taking poison and waiting for the other person to die,\" will not dissuade a scorpion. \n",

      "to return to our scorpio scholar sighard neckel, \"in german the word for grudge is grollen...groll stands for secret, entrenched animosity or concealed hatred, and a suppressed displeasure that is prevented from turning outward by internal or external resistance. it corresponds to the english 'grudge' or 'rancor'.\" as a feminine aka internally directed sign with a hard on for secrets, scorpionic grudges are characterized by their cloak and dagger approach. \n",
