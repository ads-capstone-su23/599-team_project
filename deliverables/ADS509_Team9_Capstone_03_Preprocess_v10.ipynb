      "alaska salmon season back on after court halts closure that sought to protect orcasa us appeals court has halted a lower court ruling that would have shut down southeast alaskas chinook salmon troll fishery for the summer to protect endangered orca whales that eat the fishbymark pressjune pmfile two commercial troll fishing boats pass each other on june at mountain point in ketchikan alaska. a us appeals court on wednesday june halted a lower court ruling that would have shut down southeast alaskas chinook salmon fishery for the summer to protect endangered orca whales that eat the fish. dustin safranekketchikan daily via ap filethe pressanchorage alaska a us appeals court on wednesday halted a lower court ruling that would have shut down southeast alaskas chinook salmon troll fishery for the summer to protect endangered orca whales that eat the fish. the ruling by a three judge th circuit court panel means the summer chinook or king salmon season will start as usual next week for an industry that supports some fishery workers in southeast alaska. the opinion said the state others who were part of the appeal established a sufficient likelihood that certain substantial impacts of the lower courts decision outweigh the speculative environmental threats. the ruling will allow the fishery to continue while the appeals court considers the lawsuit more broadly. the ruling recognized the absurdity of closing down a vital economic industry for an issue that is already being remedied by the federal government alaska attorney general treg taylor said in a statement. thanks to the th circuit fishing season is on come july. last month us district judge richard jones in seattle ruled in favor of wild fish conservancy ordered the national marine fisheries services to redo a biological opinion thats required for the fishery to take place. the winter chinook season could also have been impacted by jones decision. the conservation group said it would help provide more food for starving whales help struggling king salmon populations along the west coast since most of the salmon caught in southeast alaska spawn in rivers to the south. in a statement wednesday wild fish conservancy said it was disheartened by the ruling. it warned of unfathomable economic ecological cultural costs of losing west coast chinook salmon southern resident killer whales a population of orcas that spend summer fall in washington states puget sound. it is unfortunate that the ninth circuit determined the short term economic interests of a few should be prioritized over the continued existence of these species the current future generations of first nations tribal nations communities throughout the pacific northwest the group said. tad fujioka the chairman of the seafood producers cooperative said the troll fishermen in his cooperative would have likely faced a pay cut if not for the appeals courts decision leaving them with little since their margins are normally so narrow. its a big big relief for me all the trollers all the people in the southeast who depend on the troll fishery fujioka said. in small villages trolling is one of the few things that you can do that provides year round employment. trolling is a hook line fishery that involves towing baited hooks lures. about a third of southeast alaska trollers are citizens of native tribes who use traditional knowledge to support their families commuities according to a brief filed with the appeals court friday by tribes two other native organizations. troll caught chinook also help native families offset high grocery prices in a place where goods like meat produce can run two to three times higher than elsewhere. linda behnken executive director of the alaska longline fishermens association said the broad support that came from the states congressional delegation tribes commercial fishers showed the importance of the issue ultimately defeating the lawsuit. us sen. dan sullivan an alaska republican said there would have been substantial financial harm possibly totalling over million if fishing were not allowed this summer. its great that the court recognized the irreparable harm this frivolous lawsuit would have on hardworking fishermen who have done nothing wrong he said. it is patently ridiculous to believe a small boat hook line troll salmon fishery hundreds of miles away from puget sound is having more of an impact on the sustainability of puget sound orca whales than toxins pollution noise vessel traffic in their own backyard. in noaa fisheries approved the most recent decade long plan for the commercial troll fishery for chinook in southeast alaska with harvest limits set during negotiations between the us canada. king salmon are the largest most expensive of the pacific salmon species the southeastern fishery provides them to restaurants grocery stores around the world. they also make up the bulk of the diet for endangered orcas in the waters of the salish sea between washington state canada. due to overfishing dams development pollution chinook runs in the northwest are at a small fraction of their historical abundance the local orca population has suffered in turn. just whales remain inbreeding is a severe problem scientists are warning of extinction. in court filings the state of alaska said the fishery has little effect on the whale population salmon also face other predators on the mile kilometer journey including canadian commercial recreational fisheries tribal fisheries a separate population of killer whales steller sea lions. the th circuit got it right when it found that alaskas fishing interests outweighed the speculative environmental threats alaska gov. mike dunleavy said in a statement. the state of alaska was joined in the appeal by the alaska trollers association the federal fisheries service. the federal fisheries service said it would not comment wednesday on the ruling. a message seeking comment was sent to the conservancy group. in april officials canceled commercial most recreational king salmon fishing off california much of oregon for the second time in years after the fish returned in near record low numbers to californias rivers. reported from honolulu. \n",

      "Title: Bahamas court boosts Bankman-Fried's challenge to post-extradition charges\n",
      "a bahamas court on tuesday temporarily barred the countrys government from agreeing to let us prosecutors pursue part of their criminal case against sam bankman fried the indicted founder of now bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange ftx. last month us federal prosecutors in manhattan said they would drop five charges of foreign bribery bank fraud and conspiracy against the one time billionaire if the caribbean nation did not agree to them. those charges were not in bankman frieds initial eight count indictment last december which focused on the collapse of ftx the previous month but they were added after his extradition. ftx was based in the bahamas. the bahamas supreme court said the countrys foreign affairs minister and attorney general could not consent to the new charges until bankman fried had a formal chance to object. justice loren klein wrote that issues bankman fried has raised had a reasonable prospect of success. the decision could prolong uncertainty over whether bankman frieds scheduled oct. trial will cover all charges he faces. bankman fried has pleaded not guilty. in papers filed late monday in manhattan federal court bankman frieds lawyers said a sixth charge alleging us campaign finance violations should also be dismissed because the bahamas did not consent to it. his lawyers want the six charges dismissed or tried separately from charges of stealing from customers and lying to investors and lenders. to proceed otherwise would cause significant prejudice to mr. bankman fried and should not be permitted the lawyers wrote. a spokesman for the us attorneys office in manhattan declined to comment on tuesday. an extradition treaty between the united states and the bahamas says a country must consent before defendants can be tried on charges brought after their extradition. bankman fried has also said some of the original charges rely on a fraud theory known as right to control that the us supreme court last month declared invalid. under that theory a defendant can be convicted for depriving someone of economically valuable information not just tangible property. prosecutors have said that theory does not apply in bankman frieds case. us district judge lewis kaplan is expected to hear arguments on thursday. \n",

      "a texas police officer tells two children with their mom in a mall parking lot to be good and to wear their seat belts when a burst of gunfire erupts. the mother is then seen in footage from the officers body camera ducking and whisking her children to safety as the officer calls for back up. the allen police department released footage wednesday from the body camera worn by the officer who ultimately confronted and fatally shot a mass shooter who killed eight people including two elementary school children last month at an outlet mall in allen texas. this video shows how quickly a routine interaction with the public turned into a life and death situation allen police chief brian harvey said in a statement released wednesday. the officer recognized the danger ran toward the gunfire and neutralized the threat and for his actions the allen community is forever grateful. mauricio garcia started firing an ar style rifle in the parking lot of allen premium outlets on may before making his way through the complex as shoppers and employees ran for cover authorities said. the video just over five and a half minutes long begins with the officer interacting with the family when they hear shots being fired. i think we got shots fired at the outlet mall the officer is heard saying. people running. the video shows the officer returning to his vehicle to retrieve a rifle and then running toward the gunfire warning people to leave. go go get moving he yelled. get out of here. as he moves closer to the sound of gunfire the officer communicates through his radio that there was a active shooting. i believe weve got a mass shooter he said. the officer could be heard on the video yelling for the shooter to drop his weapon as shots were being fired. im passing injured he said. im moving as fast as i can the officer said moments later. video shows the out of breath officer making his way close to the sounds of gunshots when he stops and fires his weapon multiple times. shots fired by police i got him down he said. he continues firing and yells for the shooter to drop the gun. the officer moves toward the downed shooter. get away from there the officer yells at one point. im moving up on him the officer said getting closer to the downed suspect. i got him down im not hearing any gunshots. is he down. another officer said hes dead. grand jury finds police use of force was justified the footage was released following a grand jury hearing tuesday where a no bill was returned indicating that the use of force by police was justified under texas law. the video was edited by police to blur out the faces of civilians and victims and some language has been removed according to the statement. in addition to the fatalities at least seven other people were transported to hospitals for treatment including a year old child. shoppers and employees scrambled into storage areas and hid when they heard gunshots. witnesses said some people sheltered in place for up to two hours as law enforcement cleared the sprawling complex. garcia was terminated from the army due to health concerns and may have been driven by right wing extremism sources told. a us defense official told garcia was separated from the army about years ago because of a mental health condition after an evaluation. under army regulations at the time a commander could approve the separation of a service member for physical or mental health conditions that interfere with an assignment or performance of duty. army spokesperson heather hagan said garcia was terminated in june after three months in the service and did not complete basic training. at the mall the gunman had eight weapons with him three on his person and five in his vehicle. most of his weapons were purchased from private sellers which means garcia didnt have to go through a federal background check. the shooter obtained the firearms over time the source said adding this was not an instance where he rushed to buy weapons prior to the attack. the weapons were all legally obtained texas department of public safety regional director hank sibley told reporters. while no official motive has been announced the gunman was wearing an insignia authorities believe may be associated with extremist groups a senior law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told at the time. the insignia appears to be shown in a photo on an account on the russian social media website odnoklassniki that a law enforcement source said investigators believe belongs to the shooter. the user posted writings approving of nazi ideology shared images of his firearms and uploaded a photo of the mall in the weeks before the shooting according to the source. \n",

      "a former russian diplomat said the wagner groups attempted rebellion over the weekend could accelerate putins eventual ouster. the beginning of the end of putin started when he invaded ukraine. his war was from the very beginning doomed boris bondarev told newsweek on tuesday. this mutiny is just another step. bondarev previously served as russias representative to the un mission in geneva. he quit his post in may after criticizing russias war in ukraine. bondarev currently lives in switzerland with his family where he has received political asylum per the moscow times. the former diplomat has since become a vocal critic of putins government and now writes about his experience for publications such as the economist and foreign affairs. bondarev said the war has been a source of frustration among russias elite and that the mutiny reinforces their disillusionment about putins leadership. slowly the disappointment and anger and irritation among the elite has been growing but this prigozhin thing i think has given great impetus to this and people start understanding and realizing in a more clear way that the situation is very wrong it is very unhealthy bondarev told newsweek. so the situation will lead eventually to the great understanding that putin must go he continued. the wagner groups mutiny erupted after a long running feud between its chief yevgeny prigozhin and the russian military leadership. in the lead up to the attempted mutiny the mercenary group leader had been growing increasingly critical of russias war in ukraine. prigozhin called off the rebellion on the same day after striking a deal with the kremlin. as part of the agreement prigozhin has been exiled to belarus in exchange for not being prosecuted for the rebellion. bondarevs remarks come among reports of infighting within the russian military leadership. the new york times reported on tuesday that a senior russian general was aware of prigozhins mutiny plans citing unnamed us officials who were briefed on the matter. the russian embassy did not respond to the times request for comment. the officials told the times that other russian generals may also have supported mr. prigozhins attempt to change the leadership of the defense ministry by force. a representative for russias defense ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment from sent outside regular hours. \n",

      "Title: Putin has been exposed as a 'lame duck,' experts say: 'I have the feeling he is not really running the country'\n",
      "yevgeny prigozhins rebellion may have abruptly ended before wagners forces entered moscow but the very fact that a warlord and thousands of his soldiers were able to threaten the capital and that a foreign leader had to step in to negotiate a peace deal is a humiliating blow to russian president vladimir putin from which he will never fully recover experts said in the wake of a remarkable hours. the mutiny was not ostensibly about putin at all. in his public remarks prigozhin directed his criticism at russias military leaders accusing them of mismanaging the war in ukraine and undermining his private military company the culmination of a months long feud coming just days before the ministry of defense was set to formally take over control of groups such as wagner. but experts say russians will not soon forget the sight of mercenaries seizing military installations capturing a city home to more than one million people and marching to within striking distance of the kremlin prompting emergency counter terrorist measures and a desperate attempt to thwart wagners advance by tearing up the road into moscow. mikhail zygar a russian journalist and author of the book all the kremlins men told the new yorker that prigozhin a former prisoner whose brand of populist straight talk has won him a massive following on social media and who may have larger political ambitions effectively exposed putin as the sort of out of touch elite he used to decry. the student became the master or at least threatened to. there came a moment when prigozhin was no longer putins puppet zygar said. pinocchio became a real boy. zygar added that while the crisis was staved off following the intervention of belarus president alexsandr lukashenko the damage is doneputin is weaker. i have the feeling he is not really running the country. certainly not the way he once did. he is still president but all the different clans now have the feeling that russia after putin is getting closer. putin is still alive. he is still there in his bunker. but there is the growing feeling that he is a lame duck and they have to prepare for russia after putin. that assessment was shared by the institute for the study of war a washington based think tank. researchers with the group said the mutiny though it did not topple the government embarrassed putin before friend and foe alike revealing that he no longer enjoys a monopoly of force within his own countrythe optics of belarusian president lukashenko playing a direct role in halting a military advance on moscow are humiliating to putin and may have secured lukashenko other benefits. suggestions that prigozhins rebellion the kremlins response and lukashenkos mediation were all staged by the kremlin are absurd. the imagery of putin appearing on national television to call for the end of an armed rebellion and warning of a repeat of the revolution and then requiring mediation from a foreign leader to resolve the rebellion will have a lasting impact. the rebellion exposed the weakness of the russian security forces and demonstrated putins inability to use his forces in a timely manner to repel an internal threat and further eroded his monopoly on force. a senior fellow at the carnegie endowment andrew kolesnikov told the wall street journal that both prigozhin and putin his erstwhile ally were harmed by saturdays aborted march on the capital. prigozhins tough talk was followed by an apparent deal that will see him exiled to belarus with putin also now seen as a man whose actions cannot live up to his rhetoric according to kolesnikov who was in moscow on saturday. the entire system has lost yesterday including prigozhin who is also part of the system kolesnikov said. turned out that the czar is not a real czar because he couldnt control a man from his own system whos supposed to be under his full control. mick ryan who served as a major general in the australian military before joining the center for strategic and international studies told insiders katherine tangalakis lippert that the mutiny signals the beginning of the end for putins regime. putins authority has been challenged openly and he hasnt come out looking very good ryan said adding that somewhere down the track when we look at the fall of putin this was where it began. have a news tip. email this reporter \n",

      "Title: Tunisia Demands International Bailout to Slow Illegal Migration to Europe\n",
      "tunis tunisia ap tunisias increasingly autocratic president hosted the leaders of italy the netherlands and the european union on sunday for talks aimed at smoothing the way for an international bailout and restoring stability to a country that has become a major source of migration to europe. on the eve of the talks tunisian president kais saied made an unannounced visit to a migrant camp in the coastal city of sfax a central jumping off point for boat journeys crossing the mediterranean to italy. saied spoke with families living in the camp and pleaded for international aid for africans who converge on tunisia as a transit point to reach europe. his caring words and sympathetic images posted on the presidents facebook page contrasted sharply with saieds stance earlier this year when he stoked racist abuse of black african migrants in tunisia with a speech railing against a perceived plot to erase his countrys arab identity. support from tunisias president is crucial to any european deal to curb migration. tunisian prime minister najla bouden met sunday with italian premier giorgia meloni dutch prime minister mark rutte and european commission president ursula von der leyen according to images released by melonis office. stemming migration is a top priority for the far right meloni who was making her second trip in a week to tunisia. italy is the destination for most europe bound migrants leaving from the north african nation whose economy is teetering toward collapse. saied has balked at conditions for billion in stalled international monetary fund support which include cuts to subsidies on flour and fuel cuts to the large public administration sector and the privatization of loss making public companies. the president warns such moves would unleash social unrest and bristles at what he calls western diktats. the population is already restive and disillusioned with both saieds leadership and the countrys decade long experiment with democracy. that has pushed more and more tunisians to risk dangerous boat journeys across the mediterranean to seek a better life in europe. tunisia is also a major transit point for others seeking to migrate sub saharan africans make up the majority of those who leave from tunisias shores. tunisia is a priority because destabilization in tunisia would have serious repercussions on the stability of all northern africa and those repercussions inevitably arrive here meloni said thursday. meloni govt declares state of emergency as italy sees illegal boat migration quadruple april the european leaders brought a packet of initiatives to improve security in tunisia easing the way for the international monetary funds help meloni said ahead of sundays meetings. the european commission said talks would center on making progress on an eu tunisia agreement focused on the economy energy and migration. saied has said that addressing his countrys problems requires not only improved security but also tools to eliminate misery poverty and deprivation. the fitch ratings agency further downgraded tunisias default rating from ccc to cccon friday meaning the country is inching closer to potentially defaulting on its debt. the agency cited the governments failure to pursue the reforms needed to free up the imf funds. tunisias budget deficit was aggravated by the covid pandemic and fallout from russias war in ukraine and the imf aid was stalled amid political tensions and saied resistance to the required reforms. saied disbanded parliament and had the constitution rewritten to give more power to the presidency and has overseen a crackdown on opposition figures and independent media. saied said tunisia is struggling to cope with migrants from other african countries who settle in tunisia or transit through and called for international aid to fight migrant smuggling networks that consider these immigrants as merchandise thrown into the sea or the sands of the desert. during his visit to the sfax camp saturday the president described african migrants as victims of a global system that treats them not as human beings but as mere numbers and it is unacceptable for us to play the policeman for other countries. the solution must be collective and this situation that tunisia is going through is abnormal and we must put an end to this inhuman situation. he did not address the large numbers of tunisians leaving his country for europe. for years tunisia has been one of the few countries with repatriation agreements with italy and so tunisians who enter illegally and do not have grounds to seek asylum are sent back. a migrants advocacy group the tunisian forum for economic and social rights held a demonstration when meloni visited the country on tuesday and planned another for sunday. the group and some other organizations issued a joint statement denouncing the italian governments repressive policy towards illegal migrants and the forced repatriation of the latter to their countries of origin. the eus member countries on thursday sealed agreement on a plan to share responsibility for migrants entering europe without authorization the root of one of the blocs longest running political crises. the plan is still in the early stages and may meet resistance at the european parliament. italy tells eu send money to africa to stop mass migration

      "athletes taylor silverman and riley gaines will host a protest over the inclusion of male cyclist austin killips in the womens category at the usa cycling pro road national championship on sunday according to reports. killips is a biological male who has claimed to transition to a female and has been competing in cycle races as a woman for several years racking up a growing number of wins in the female category. the cyclist claiming to be a transgender woman most recently won the womens title at the belgian waffle ride north carolina on june. it was a win that tennis legend martina navratilova denounced as a joke. killips wins have spurred skateboarder champion taylor silverman and former ncaa swimming champion riley gaines to protest the usa cycling event for allowing killips to compete as a woman. i hope that uci and usa cycling hears us and decides to change the rules that currently allow male athletes like killips to compete in the womens division because its simply unfair silverman said according to outkick. and it is not right that the women have to miss out on their opportunities because of one persons feelings. silverman says that she lost qualifying positions because men claiming to be women competed in her category. come join us at the pro national womens cycling championship in knoxville tennessee this weekend. rally and press conference will take place at pm on june th at pat summitt plaza. iwf iwn rileygaines ithompsonfdn paulayscanlan barbaraehardt pic. twitter. com wvawpgiqx taylor silverman june two of those times i actually got bumped out of first place into second and ive also lost out on prize money silverman said during an appearance on fox business network. i understood that this was not fair. it was wrong so i reached out to contest organizers after the third contest and it was with red bull. so i reached out to them and raised my concerns and they completely ignored me which led me to share my story on social media where i truly began to understand how big of an issue this was. silverman added that she was attacked for raising issues of transgender athletes in womens sports. i get hundreds of thousands of messages every month from people thanking me for speaking up whether that be female athletes parents coaches silverman said. but she also added that she has seen supporters too noting ive gotten everything from job offers to marriage proposals. so there are people who are very grateful that im using my voice on this issue. gaines of course has been an extremely outspoken advocate for banning men claiming to be women from competing in womens sports. sports has detailed many of gaines actions to protect womens sports. gaines also specifically blasted usa cycling and austin killips after the recent win in north carolina and advised women to start taking a knee and refusing to participate in competitions where men are entered as women. next weekend is the pro national cycling championship in knoxville. join us in sunday june th pm at pat summit plaza for the rally to savewomenssports featuring iwn rileygaines ithompsonfdn paulayscanlan and more. pic. twitter. comfb eftnqjw jill savage june follow on facebook at facebook. comwarner.. or truth social warnertoddhuston. \n",

      "Title: Why a misguided Republican ‘hearing’ on Jan. 6 rioters matters\n",
      "in the us house when a party is in the minority it will sometimes organize events that are intended to look like real congressional hearings but theyre really not. its the house majority that controls the committees and its up to committee chairs to decide whether or not to hold proper legitimate hearings. members in the minority will occasionally organize informal meetings describe invitees as witnesses and hope the media takes an interest but for all intents and purposes theyre theatrical presentations intended to shine a light on concerns the majority prefers to ignore. whats weird is when members of the majority feel the need to hold their own fake hearing. politico reported just so were clear this was not an actual congressional hearing. the far right floridian however wanted it to be perceived as one. gaetz pretended to be a chairman recognizing members and witnesses alerting participants to when their time had expired and explaining that the testimony could be used in official proceedings. that last part was true but irrelevant anything can be used in official proceedings including the blog post youre reading now. the gop congressman labeled this exercise a capitol hill field hearing and he invited a motley crew of house republicans to join him reps. andy biggs of arizona paul gosar of arizona marjorie taylor greene of georgia troy nehls of texas and ralph norman of south carolina. the ostensible point was to further the far right investigation into the weaponization of the federal government. but just as notable was the message gaetz sent with his list of witnesses. the washington posts dana milbank who covered the event highlighted the republicans guests the wife of ronald mcabee who is awaiting trial for allegedly attacking a police officer and dragging him into the mob while wearing a black vest that said sheriff. underwear model john strand sentenced to two years and eight months for being part of the mob that breached the capitol on jan. and pushed past police officers. activist brandon straka sentenced to home detention and probation and fined for his jan. actions. the aunt of matthew perna perna committed suicide while awaiting sentencing for his role in breaching the capitol. ed martin an organizer of the stop the steal effort leading up to jan.. and jeffrey clark the trump justice department official who tried to get states to toss the election results. greene told the guests they were victims of sick evil people. norman added that he considers it heartbreaking the way you all have been treated. the point obviously wasnt to investigate a weaponized government. rather as milbank explained the gathering was intended to honor participants in the jan. riot family members of jan. rioters and organizers of the attempted overthrow of the vote. so why does this matter. in part because of the timing it was not a coincidence that gaetz and his radical allies held their faux hearing on midday tuesday just as donald trump was being arraigned in a florida courthouse. the larger partisan trajectory is also notable in the immediate aftermath of the attack on the us capitol gaetz was among the loudest republican voices suggesting that jan. rioters might actually have been radical leftists pretending to be trump supporters. more than two years later the floridian and his confederates have not only abandoned that line theyre now heralding the rioters as heroes and martyrs. but im also struck by the fact that the ersatz hearing was allowed to happen in the first place. it wasnt exactly surprising to see unhinged members of congress taking fresh steps to embrace what politicos report described as jan. extremism. this is after all the path theyve followed for far too long. what was surprising was the fact that house speaker kevin mccarthy and his gop leadership team who are supposed to maintain some degree of control of their conference didnt prevent this radical event from taking place. id love to hear mccarthy explain why he didnt. \n",

      "Title: It would be foolish for Dems to let Trump do all the talking about his criminal charges\n",
      "so america has arraigned a former president on federal criminal charges for allegedly leaving the white house with state secrets keeping them at his resort home and refusing to return them. its new territory for the american republic. the natural question is what happens now. what should happen. we know how trumps defenders on the right are reacting with denialism. conspiracy theories. even calls for violence. but how should democratic officials respond to this moment. how should my colleagues in the news media cover it. here are five suggestions for how to think about and talk about donald trump the federal defendant as we move deeper into this uncharted territory heading for not one but two trump trials. number one this federal case is about national security not just documents. trump took home nuclear secrets and war plans. he kept them in his resort home and according to the indictment showed them off on two occasions. people have gone to prison for much less than that. calling that a documents case is trivializing it. its like reducing watergate to just a simple office burglary. trump is accused of stealing some of the most sensitive secrets america has so this case is about the direct danger his actions put everyone in. number two dont give free publicity to trump. time and time again the man has used coverage of his own lies and corruption to rally supporters and spread more self serving lies. the tuesday he was arraigned was no exception. after his arraignment in miami trump was driven to a cafe in that citys little havana neighborhood a decades old campaign stop for presidential candidates before jetting off to his bedminster golf resort in new jersey to give yet another rambling speech about witch hunts and banana republics to his faithful devotees. how did the watchdog press respond to this circus. mostly by playing into trumps hands. momentous scene in miami read the new york times headline beside a photo of trump anointed by the us flag on his jets tail rudder. its reminiscent of when trump got an estimated five billion dollars in free media coverage more than seven times what hillary clinton got. the point is that trump sees the notoriety from being americas first indicted former president as a clear pr opportunity but the media doesnt have to help him do it. number three politics like nature abhors a vacuum. a vacuum allows trump and the maga media machine to flood the zone with lies. trump and his allies including some of his supposed primary opponents. are already blasting their own false version of the story loud and clear to the florida public any one of whom could possibly wind up on the jury deciding the former presidents fate. meanwhile president biden has ordered the dnc and his own re election campaign to remain silent about the indictment. so republicans get to endlessly run their mouths on this while democrats take a vow of silence. this is madness. i get it. president biden has to stay independent neutral and above the fray on a case involving his department of justice. but candidate biden at some point surely has to say something about his gop opponent being indicted for major and multiple crimes does he not. you cant allow trump and his republican apologists to face no political penalty for one of the biggest scandals in american history. thats just political malpractice. number four we cannot allow political violence to be normalized. a number of republicans have already responded to trumps indictment with violent bluster. whether its failed arizona gubernatorial candidate kari lake talking about million mostly armed trump supporters or the not so subtle hints at civil war from congressmen andy biggs and clay higgins. if weve learned anything from january its that we cant shrug off this rhetoric and ignore where it leads. we have to call it out at every turn and not just move on as much of the media already have. number five this is a test of american democracy but not in the way you think. maga republicans want you to believe this is a test of president biden attorney general merrick garland even the department of justice. that doesnt mean the rest of us have to regurgitate that nonsense as the new york times did with the headline trumps case puts the justice system on trial in a test of public credibility. no. the only person who is about to be on trial is donald j. trump and the test of democracy is whether or not the united states can prosecute even convict and jail a former leader without everyone losing their minds. like the rest of the world does all the time without incident. at least countries around the world have prosecuted or jailed former leaders just since the start of this century. that includes leaders from democracies and allies of ours such as france italy south korea and israel where the current prime minister benjamin netanyahu is in the middle of his own ongoing corruption trial. a reminder that in other countries even sitting leaders can face justice. so this notion that the prosecution of a former american president is somehow a corrupt and partisan attack on the political opposition or a sign of democratic dysfunction is just absurd. all across the world democracies hold their current and former leaders to account for their alleged crimes. here in america right now this isnt just about whether trump wins or loses in court. its also about whether he wins the battle for public opinion. its about whether trump and his allies are able to frame and define one of the biggest political stories of the modern era. we cant let them. this is an adapted excerpt from the show on peacock on thursday june. \n",

these pillowcases are cool to the touch super soft and they are super comfortable to lay on to the point i woke up with drool all over my face from my remarkable amount of great sleep i had. this

and lasts for up to six hours on one charge. review the older i get the less tolerant of the heat i become and i live in texas where summers can sometimes last eight months so i was anxious to try this fan. i was not disappointed. my order arrived a day early and since it was degrees fahrenheit outside i immediately ripped open the box and turned it on. i was not disappointed. it fit comfortably over my neck and the dual fans are adjustable so you can position them however is most comfy for you. the unit has six settings from soft intermittent breeze to the highest constant speed

right away. review im happy to say this product works. two times in one summer i proved my inability to adult well. i applied this lotion the minute i realized that i had experienced another exposure to the sun for too long a period. to my absolute joy this product relieved my discomfort. it left a layer that stayed cool for a few hours at which time i reapplied it it was a little tacky to the touch not sticky or oily and my skin did not experience the crocodile and subsequent peeling experience it had earlier in the season. the scent is soft and not overpowering. i have experienced skin sensitivity in the past to products but i had no issues with burts bees products. thank you for providing me with such a helpful product. meghan get it from amazon for.. and a lightweight water resistant neutrogena spf face and body stick sunscreen to keep with you so youre prepared next time you end up spending more time out in the sun than you planned. its also great for travel since its solid aka you wont get any side eye from tsa if its in your carry on. amazon shopping editor elizabeth lilly brought this on an international trip and loved it i first bought this for a weeklong croatian vacation two years ago when i did carry on and as long as you are thoroughly reapplying this stuff stays on pretty well. on a beach club afternoon i did haphazardly reapply and missed a strip on one arm but i tend to do that with spray on or lotion sunscreen too. since then ive packed this for any trip ive been on including a two day disneyland trip where i toted this around in my bag and shared with friends. i sometimes carry it with me in my purse on my everyday adventures because i know its so easy to apply. also worth mentioning i am about the palest lady youve ever seen and swear by daily application of sunscreen. but when on a beach trip im constantly swimming in the water and sweating. so yeah this stuff works. and if youre a bit hesitant about jumping on the solid sunscreen bandwagon you can pack a stick of this knowing you have enough sun protection to get you through to finding some spray on or lotion spf at your destination. get it from amazon for.. or black girl

it turns purple. if you use a sunblock it starts to become clear or semi clear. after being on the beach and having gone into the water a few times the spot started seeing purple and i applied

nighter setting spray if you dread putting on makeup on hot days because you know it wont last once you start sweating. i recently stumbled upon this holy grail product and its been a 👏 game changer 👏. it ensures your flawless lewk will survive rain sweat and nights out without smudging or transferring off inside a mask. buzzfeedi first put this setting spray to the test for a wedding that involved taking multiple trains in and out of manhattan on a hot day and being in crowded rooms where airflow was limited. as such i was sweating up a storm but my makeup looked flawless by the time i got home that night all thanks to this urban decay setting spray which i knew after one use id be repurchasing. im new to setting sprays so it felt weird at first to spray something on top of my carefully crafted makeup look but it dried in no time without messing anything up. it also didnt feel heavy or sticky on my face it didnt feel like anything at all actually and my makeup looked better than it ever has after hours of wear. for reference i have dry sensitive skin and it caused me no issues. soon after that event i put it to an even bigger task surviving sweat tears and hours of wear for the taylor swift eras tour. my makeup look pictured above was done by pm and thanks to my now highly trusted urban decay spray it stayed completely intact minus the lipstick i purposefully wiped off while scarfing down post concert pizza until the time i got home just after am heres what it endured during that timespan multi leg public transportation to and from the venue waiting in lines under the blaring sun to get in multiple meals and drinks jumping screaming and literally full on crying multiple times during the show. my liquid eyeliner eyeshadow non waterproof mascara foundation blush and even glitter were unfazed and i owe it all to this setting spray. get it from amazon or sephora for available in two sizes.. a rimmel mattifying primer some reviewers found was the only thing they needed to survive the summer heat without their face becoming shine central. if you wear makeup on top it can keep it from becoming patchy throughout the day. review never ever has anything worked this well to knock down shine and that includes actual powder and foundation and mineral products. if i apply nothing within half an hour of washing my face i start to glow. in the summer when i typically use a matte sunscreen and moisturizer my t zone might make it for an hour before it starts to shine. with this stuff i can golf or bike in degree weather sweat up a storm and theres zero shine on my face. zero. none. in fact i forgot to put it on a few times its last in my routine my face started to glow i put it on and bam shine gone. what i love about it the most is that i dont have to wear any foundation and still look put together in the heat of summer. it seems thick when you put it on but once it gets on your skin and warms up it will spread nicely. great product. i hope they never stop making it because its a life changer for me. happydogget it from amazon for.. youthforias viral byo blush oil believe me when i say this feels like nothing on your skin so it wont make your

bad that i always smell like off and its so annoying to smell like bug spray. plus im so sticky. so i wanted something that i can put out when were having dinner or hanging out with the family in the patio. these worked perfectly. they really smell good and they work as long as the candle was on i was not bit by any bugs. i wanted to carry it with me everywhere we went but not possible. short story we purchased two and were there for days. they lasted the days with very little to spare and i used them as much as possible and at night for at least five or six hours each night. i purchased

this summer. it has been hotter than usual in north georgia and ive had some very uncomfortable chafing and irritation from being so sweaty so much of the time. i had the heel of the sock pointing up

you all summer despite being natural no aluminum fragrances alcohol chemicals or any of those other toxic ingredients usually found in deodorants and antiperspirants. it sounds too good to be true but the results say otherwise. buzzfeedtaylor steelefor some background nuud is a small business based in the netherlands committed to creating fresh armpits worldwide. their anti odorant is vegan cruelty free and sustainably made. shopping writer taylor steele is a big believer in nuud its truly unbelievable. i didnt think this could really solve my smelly pit problem. but honey it did. and no matter how many times i read about how it works it feels like magic. because in one month alone i probably only had to apply it five times. i dont know how i was using aluminum filled funky making deodorant all this time instead of nuud. the only bit i kinda understand is that it works by neutralizing bacteria instead of masking it which is what regular deodorants do so theres just no odor at all. even post workout theres not even a whiff of stink. i cant recommend this enough. and no i will never ever go back to any other deodorant. did i mention that its vegan comes in a bioplastic container and is shipped in a biodegradable box. yeah nuud gets it. promising review i have been using nuud for over a year now and wow. i am a convert for life. the fact that i can apply deodorant a few times a week is a game changer. i typically only need to apply every three days or so but if i have a big event or reason to be cautious i can always apply that morning and know i am good. nolan rainsget the

high fives or any handshake hold situations uncomfortable and embarrassing. summer time and warm weather was my nightmare. for years i have been going to my dermatologist for help with no luck. with this product i experienced immediate results. i still experience some sweating at times but it is not close to the amount of sweat ive experienced at times. no more sweat pools left behind. it does

purifier to help keep your home free of indoor allergens like dust and pet dander as well as outdoor irritants that slip in like pollen and smoke especially during wildfire season. this works quietly in the background to clean your air all you have to do is replace the hepa filter as needed. buzzfeedi picked this air purifier up a while back to help manage the smell that sometimes wafts from my cats litter box when it starts to get full and to help keep my nyc apartment air cleaner in general. im also lol extremely allergic to cats and though i get allergy shots for this its also nice to help cut down on the pet dander for myself and any visitors with allergies. this thing makes a difference. it cuts down on any noticeable smell from the cats my air feels cleaner and my allergies are usually non existent in the apartment. i was especially grateful to have this recently when canadian wildfires brought smoke all the way down to nyc where the aqi air quality index was over at some points for those who dont know thats bad. it helped keep the air inside my apartment as clean as possible which made me feel better for myself and my kitties. since i have a one bedroom ill likely pick up a second one just so i dont have to move it back and forth at night. oh and its fairly quiet it basically functions as white noise which can be handy if you run this at night in the bedroom too. depending on your usage and environment its recommended to replace the filter every months replacements are available on amazon. you can see the difference between my old filter and a new replacement one above. get it from amazon for when you clip the off coupon.. a pack of ready to use fruit fly traps so you can finally go to war against the gnats and fruit flies invading your home

water in the bag started turning black and hundreds of dead flies in there. originally i got this product because i have a lime tree that flies laid eggs in the soil. after a couple of days i dont see

      "Title: Meet Pause AI, the Protest Group Campaigning Against Human Extinction\n",
      "meindertsma who is and co owns a database company has been interested in ai for a couple of years. but he really started worrying about the threat the technology could pose to humanity when open ai released its latest language model gpt in march. since then he has watched the runaway success of chatgpt chatbotbased first on gpt then gpt demonstrate to the world how far ai has progressed and big tech companies race to catch up. and he has seen pioneers like geoffrey hinton the so called godfather of ai warn of the dangers associated with the systems they helped create. ai capabilities are advancing far more rapidly than virtually anyone has predicted says meindertsma. we are risking social collapse. were risking human extinction. one month before our talk meindertsma stopped going to work. he had become so consumed by the idea that ai is going to destroy human civilization that he was struggling to think of anything else. he had to do something he felt to avert disaster. soon after he launched pause ai a grassroots protest group that campaigns for as its name suggests a halt to the development of ai. and since then he has amassed a small band of followers who have held protests in brussels london san francisco and melbourne. these demonstrations have been smallfewer than people each timebut meindertsma has been making friends in high places. already he says he has been invited to speak with officials within both the dutch parliament and at the european commission. the idea that ai could wipe out humanity sounds extreme. but its an idea thats gaining traction in both the tech sector and in mainstream politics. hinton quit his role at google in may and embarked on a global round of interviews in which he raised the specter of humans no longer being able to control ai as the technology advances. that same month industry leadersincluding the ceos of ai labs google deepmind openai and anthropicsigned a letter acknowledging the risk of extinction and uk prime minister rishi sunak became the first head of government to publicly admit he also believes that ai poses an existential risk to humanity. meindertsma and his followers offer a glimpse of how these warnings are trickling through society creating a new phenomenon of ai anxiety and giving a younger generationmany of whom are already deeply worried about climate changea new reason to feel panic about the future. a survey by the pollster yougov found that the proportion of people worried that artificial intelligence would lead to an apocalypse rose sharply in the last year. hinton denies he wants ai development to be stopped temporarily or indefinitely. but his public statements about the risk ai poses to humanity have resulted in a group of young people who feel there is no other choice. but the pause ai founder also worries about a future where ai advances enough to be classified as super intelligent and decides to wipe out civilization once it understands that humans limit ais power. he echoes an argument also used by hinton that if humans ask a future super intelligent ai system to fulfill any goal ai might create its own dangerous sub goals in the process. this concern dates back years and is generally credited to the swedish philosopher and oxford university professor nick bostrom who first described in the early s what hypothetically could happen if a super intelligent ai was asked to create as many paperclips as possible. the ai will realize quickly that it would be much better if there were no humans because humans might decide to switch it off bostrom said in a interview. also human bodies contain a lot of atoms that could be made into paper clips. the future that the ai would be trying to gear towards would be one in which there were a lot of paper clips but no humans. ai research is a divided field and some experts who might be expected to rip meindertsmas ideas apart instead seem reluctant to discredit them. because of the rapid progress we just dont know how much of science fiction could become reality says clark barrett co director of stanford universitys center for ai safety in california. barrett does not believe a future where ai helps develop cyber weapons is plausible. this is not a field where ai has so far excelled he claims. but he is less willing to dismiss the idea that an ai system that evolves to be smarter than humans could work maliciously against us. people worry that an ai system could try to steal all of our energy or steal all of our compute power or try to manipulate people into doing what it wants us to do. this is not realistic right now he says. but we dont know what the future can bring. so i cant say its impossible. yet other ai researchers have less patience with the hypothetical debate. for me it is a problematic narrative that people claim any kind of proof or likelihood that ai is going to be self conscious and turn against humanity says theresa zuger head of humboldt universitys ai and society lab based in germany. there is no evidence that this is going to appear and in other scientific fields we wouldnt discuss this if there is no evidence. this lack of consensus among experts is enough for meindertsma to justify his groups demand for a global halt to ai development. the most sensible thing to do right now is to pause ai developments until we know how to build ai safely he says claiming that leaps forward in ai capabilities have become divorced from research on safety. the debate about how the relationship between these two halves of the ai industry have evolved is also taking place in mainstream academia. this is something that ive seen getting worse over the years says ann nowe head of the artificial intelligence lab at the free university in brussels. when you were trained in the s to do ai you had to understand the application field she adds explaining it was normal for ai researchers to spend time speaking to people working in the schools or hospitals where their system would be used. now a lot of ai people are not trained in having this conversation with stakeholders about whether this is ethical or legally compliant. the government mandated pause meindertsma envisions would have to be organized by governments of different countries at an international summit he says. when british prime minister rishi sunak announced the uk would host a global summit on ai safety in the autumn meindertsma interpreted this as a flash of hope. he believes the uk is well suited to make sure were not rushing towards a doomsday scenario. its the home for many ai safety scientists. its where deepmind is currently located. you have members of parliament already calling for an ai safety summit to prevent extinction. yet sunaks announcement was also tinged with ambitions to make the uk a hub of ai industrysimultaneously revealing that the company palantir would base its new european headquarters in londonimplying the likelihood of the uk advocating for an industrywide pause is remote. the group is small. there are seven protesters in total all of them young men in their teens or early twenties. their experience of ai varies. one is a politics student another works at a nonprofit dedicated to ai safety. several have a background in protesting against climate change. one of the main similarities between climate change and ai is the fact that you have a few companies risking peoples lives today and even more lives in the future for the sake essentially of making profits says futerman. he shares meindertsmas concerns or versions of them. one future scenario hes worried about is that leading ai companies could develop artificial super intelligence. if that happened he believes these models would gain the power to significantly reduce human agency over our future. theyre aiming to build a doomsday device he says. in the worst case scenario this could wipe us out. among the cluster of protesters is ben an animal rights activist with a mane of red hair who declines to share his surname because he doesnt want his ai activism to affect his career. before the protest we go for coffee to talk about why he joined pause ai. there was definitely a time when i felt that the extinction risk argument was science fiction or overblown he explains the earring in his left ear gently shaking as he becomes more animated. then as chatgpt came out and gpt it became apparent to me how powerful these ai models were getting and also how fast they were increasing in their power. ben has never communicated directly with meindertsma he met fellow pause ai members through a london coworking space. he believes his animal rights activism gives him a template to understand the dynamic between different species with varying degrees of intelligence. its difficult to predict what a world would look like with a different more intelligent species than the human existing he says. but we know that our relationship with species that are less intelligent than us hasnt been great for those other species. if you look at humanitys relationship with other animals some of them we farm and slaughter for our own purposes. and many of them were driven to extinction. he acknowledges some of the scenarios pause ai is warning about might never happen. but even if they dont powerful ai systems will likely turbocharge problems that technology has already accelerated in our societies he says such as labor issues and racial and gender bias. people who are concerned about ai extinction also take these problems really seriously. the second time i speak to meindertsma hes in a better mood. he has new recruits he feels the world is listening. he has just returned from brussels where he was invited to a meeting at the european commission declining to publicly name the official he met in case that sours the relationship. and now the uk is holding the global summit he has spent weeks campaigning for. so i feel like were making a lot of progress in a short time he says. as pause ais ideas gain traction politicians and ai companies are still figuring out how to respondwith researchers divided about whether their concerns help garner support for ai safety research or simply spread panic about future scenarios that might never happen. meindertsma argues that intelligence is power and thats what makes it dangerous. but every day supposedly intelligent humans try to take more power for themselves and find their efforts blocked by institutions and systems specifically designed to contain it according to stanfords clark barrett. he might not be willing to predict how ai might evolve but he does believe society is more prepared than pause ai might give it credit for. there are certain barriers in place that i think shouldnt be underestimated in terms of preventing this kind of runaway effect that people are worried about. \n",

      "Title: Supreme Court to rule on Biden's student debt relief plan Friday\n",
      "washington the supreme court on friday invalidated president joe bidens student loan debt relief plan meaning the long delayed proposal intended to implement a campaign trail promise will not go into effect. the justices divided on ideological lines ruled in one of two cases that the program was an unlawful exercise of presidential power because it had not been explicitly approved by congress. biden said the ruling was disappointing and vowed to take additional steps to relieve the financial burden on those holding student loan debt. i will stop at nothing to find other ways to deliver relief to hard working middle class families he said. my administration will continue to work to bring the promise of higher education to every american. the court rejected the biden administrations arguments that the plan was lawful under a law called the higher education relief opportunities for students act or heroes act. the law says the government can provide relief to recipients of student loans when there is a national emergency allowing it to act to ensure people are not in a worse position financially as a result of the emergency. chief justice john roberts said the heroes act language was not specific enough writing that the courts precedent requires that congress speak clearly before a department secretary can unilaterally alter large sections of the american economy. the plan which would have allowed eligible borrowers to cancel up to in debt and would have cost more than billion has been blocked since the th us circuit court of appeals issued a temporary hold in october. about million americans would have been eligible to participate. the student loan proposal was important politically to biden as tackling student loan debt was a key pledge he made on the campaign trail in to energize younger voters. the ruling immediately puts pressure on the administration to find an alternative avenue to forgive student debt that could potentially withstand legal challenge. biden said friday that he would invoke the higher education act a different law than the one at issue in the supreme court cases which some experts have said gives the education department broad authority although that proposal could take time to implement. senate majority leader chuck schumer d ny said the ruling was disappointing and cruel and noted that the biden administration has remaining legal routes to provide broad based student debt cancellation. republicans welcomed the ruling with senate minority leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky saying bidens student loan socialism plan would be a raw deal for hardworking taxpayers. separately the student loan repayment process is set to begin again at the end of august after having been put on pause during the covid pandemic although first payments will not be due until october. the court considered two cases one brought by six states including missouri and the other brought by two people who hold student loan debt myra brown and alexander taylor. the court ruled that the program was unlawful in the case brought by states but found in the second case that the challengers did not have legal standing. the three liberal justices on the conservative majority bench dissented with justice elena kagan saying that by ruling against the plan the court had exceeded its proper limited role in our nations governance. she said the states bringing the challenge did not have legal standing to even bring the case and in analyzing heroes act the conservative justices ignored the clear language of the law. the result here is that the court substitutes itself for congress and the executive branch in making national policy about student loan forgiveness kagan wrote. the court decided the case in part based on a legal argument made by the challengers that the conservative majority has recently embraced called the major questions doctrine. under the theory federal agencies cannot initiate sweeping new policies that have significant economic impacts without having express authorization from congress. the conservative majority cited the major questions doctrine last year in blocking bidens covid vaccination or test requirement for larger businesses and curbing the authority of the environmental protection agency to limit carbon emissions from power plants. the challengers argued that the administrations proposal announced by biden in august and originally scheduled to take effect last fall violated the constitution and federal law partly because it circumvented congress which they said has the sole power to create laws related to student loan forgiveness. biden had proposed canceling student loan debt during the presidential election campaign. the administration ultimately proposed forgiving up to in debt for borrowers earning less than a year or couples who file taxes jointly and earn less than annually. pell grant recipients who are the majority of borrowers would be eligible for more in debt relief. the administration closed the application process after the plan was blocked. holders of student loan debt currently do not have to make payments as part of covid relief measures that will remain in effect until after the supreme court issues its ruling. the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated in september that bidens plan would cost billion.

      "Title: Nikki Haley’s husband begins Africa deployment as she campaigns for 2024 GOP nomination\n",
      "charleston sc nikki haleys husband deployed saturday for a yearlong stint in africa with south carolina army national guard a mission that will encompass most of remainder of her campaign for republican presidential nomination. hes always been my rock she said after a deployment ceremony for about soldiers at citadel a military college in charleston. we have both lived a life of service and so when he goes off to deploy my support is completely with him. if i happen to be running for president his support is completely with me. we will continue to stay in touch as best we can. maj. michael haley is being deployed as a staff officer with th maneuver enhancement brigade which national guard says is providing support in horn of africa. united nations where nikki haley served as donald trumps ambassador for two years says that region is facing worst drought in years with more than million people in need of assistance in somalia ethiopia and kenya and more than half of those lacking access to sufficient food. last month a high level un conference raised less than billion of more than billion organizers were hoping for to help more than million people in horn of africa cope with climate crisis and mass displacement after years of conflict. nikki haley who is also a former south carolina governor has been highly critical of president joe bidens performance as commander in chief. she has spoken out against his administrations efforts to expand diversity in military complaining they were weakening force and hampering recruitment though army has said that real problem is that many young people do not see enlistment as safe or a good career path. she has also pledged to make cuts in billion in foreign aid to countries that she says hate america. michael haley candidates husband of years has been a constant at his wifes campaign events since she became a white house candidate. during his deployment campaign said couples college age son nalin will be taking over that role. nikki haley frequently mentions her status as a military wife. joining guard as an officer in her husband made his first overseas deployment january when she was midway through her first term as governor and their children were age and. he left me as a single mom governor but were still married haley said during a recent campaign appearance in greer south carolina. she went on to critique biden administrations chaotic withdrawal from afghanistan in. citing current deployment during a cnn town hall in iowa this month haley called it start of a yearlong prayer that theyre effective and that theyre strong and that they come home safely. she has also referenced her husbands upcoming deployment in terms of us department of justices case against rival trump on charges of mishandling classified documents including national defense information. arguing that two things can be be true a same time and echoing many republicans arguments that doj and fbi have lost all credibility with american people haley said on fox this past week that if this indictment is true if what it says is actually case president trump was incredibly reckless with our national security. my husband is about to deploy this weekend haley went on. this puts all of our military men and women in danger if you are going to talk about what our military is capable of or how we would go about invading or doing something with one of our enemies. on saturday haley said her husbands service has in part framed her viewpoint on foreign policy and military strategy. we dont want to go into a way thats going to put our men and women at harms danger. they are going because africa is a hotbed haley said. weve always known that when our men and women go overseas its to keep us safe here at home. \n",

      "president joe bidens billion student loan forgiveness program survived a procedural challenge on wednesday as the house couldnt find the votes to override his veto of a bill aimed at killing the program. the house passed a resolution in may to end what republicans say is an illegal attempt by biden to forgive billions in student loans effectively throwing that debt on the backs of taxpayers. after the senate approved the same resolution biden vetoed it in june. on wednesday the house tried to override that veto but failed to reach the two thirds majority needed. the house voted to override biden dozens of votes short of the target thanks to democrats who all voted to protect bidens veto except for two who voted with the gop. gop rolls out student loan plan as bidens billion handout faces supreme court test rep. bobby scott d va. argued on behalf of democrats that million americans are eligible for loan relief under bidens plan many of whom are low income people who need such relief. but rep. virginia foxx r nc argued that americans know that the program unfairly shifts this debt to taxpayers. president bidens radical plan to cancel up to in student debt via executive fiat is utter hogwash. the american people are not fooled by the deceptive doctored up talking points on student loans that the left has attempted to force feed them over the past two years. the house vote effectively kills the attempt by republicans in congress to terminate bidens controversial loan program. but the supreme court may yet rule against it in an upcoming case and could issue that ruling in a matter of days. biden vetoes canceling his billion student loan handout vows hes not going to back down the resolution was written under the congressional review act which allows congress to kill recent executive branch decisions. the house passed the resolution in may and that was followed by a vote in the senate neither of those margins were enough to override bidens veto. when biden vetoed the resolution he argued that the covid pandemic was a reason to provide up to in student loan debt relief to millions of americans. the pandemic was devastating for families across the nation biden said. to give borrowers the essential relief they need as they recover from the economic strains associated with the covid pandemic the department of education created a program to provide up to in debt relief and up to for pell grant recipients reaching more than million hard working americans. biden student loan redistribution could benefit felons gop officials claim in letter demanding details while the covid emergency is over biden and other democrats say that relief is still needed. it is a shame for working families across the country that lawmakers continue to pursue this unprecedented attempt to deny critical relief to millions of their own constituents even as several of these same lawmakers have had tens of thousands of dollars of their own business loans forgiven by the federal government biden said in his veto message. \n",

will be asking more than passengers to take part in a weight survey beginning in june. the survey is essential to the safe and efficient operation of the aircraft and is a civil aviation authority requirement air zealand wrote in a statement. the survey will calculate passengers average weight to help the planes fly more efficiently while also remaining balanced. people traveling through the airlines domestic network were weighed in and now that international travel is spiking again covid they want international travelers to participate. we weigh everything that goes on the aircraft from the cargo to the meals onboard to the luggage in the hold. for customers crew and cabin bags we use average weights which we get from doing this survey air zealand load control improvement specialist alastair james explained in the statement. the survey which will take place at the entrance of certain air zealand flights departing from auckland international airport between may and july is anonymous and voluntary. we know stepping on the scales can be daunting. we want to reassure our customers there is no visible display anywhere. no one can see your weight not even us. its completely

one person said. when i go to the doctor i dont even look at the scale so i dont want that out there in public another added. a clip of a woman being asked to step on a baggage scale which was

divided tiktok with one viewer writing why are people so mean. another recalled being subject to a similar precaution explaining flying home from the philippines and they weighed me i have never been so embarrassed in my life. however others sided with the airline with one customer questioning why would she lie and risk all our lives including hers lol. they care about weight limits on small planes because they need to have the center weight in a certain part of the plane said another. a woman went viral for sharing that she was forced to step on a baggage scale before boarding her flight. in the federal aviation administration advisory announced that airlines could soon require plus size passengers to step on the scale or provide their weight before boarding the aircraft. the goal was to provide data on average passenger weights as the current numbers reportedly dont reflect todays sky high obesity rates in the us. in turn this would help ensure that aircraft especially small ones dont exceed their allowable weight limit. once theyve chosen a traveler an operator may determine the actual weight of passengers by having them step on a scale before boarding the aircraft per the guidelines transcribed by airinsight. in order to protect passenger privacy they stipulated the scale readout should remain hidden from public view. however the regulatory agency backpedaled a month later claiming that while weighing passengers was an option most airlines would resort to other measures of calculating passenger mass. contingency methods included making a reasonable estimate about the passengers actual weight and add pounds per the document. nbc news aviation expert john cox said on today that he believes other airlines could implement a weight survey in the future. its critically important for the safety of flight that you know how much the airplane weighs its particularly certificated to perform in a given way at a given weight he said. \n",

      "Title: How To Overcome AI Shame While Maintaining Your Brand's Authenticity\n",
      "founder ceo of scs a global brand transformation agency that uses data science and creativity to help brands perform. getty recently i was discussing with a brand how to implement artificial intelligence in their business. known for their strong brand ethos authenticity storytelling and incredible product the brand was eager to use ai to boost the efficiency of their marketing execution as well as for product planning but didnt want to impact their ethos as a human curated brand. we have all felt it the shame surrounding ai in the professional world is very real. brands and individuals alike worry that embracing ai might tarnish their image of authenticity while others feel like theyre cheating when they use ai to augment their work. this sense of shame however shouldnt prevent us from recognizing the true potential of ai to enhance our capabilities and ultimately make us better humans. how brands are using ai right now how do we move past this. i think it begins with focusing on what makes us human and then considering how ai can amplify our innate strengths. to do this i think we can learn from real world examples of companies that have successfully integrated ai into their operations while maintaining their authenticity starbucks uses ai to enhance its customer experience through its deep brew recommendation engine. by leveraging ai in this way starbucks provides a more tailored experience for its customers without sacrificing human connections in its stores. more fromforbes advisorbest travel insurance companies best covid travel insurance plans stitch fix an online personal styling service uses ai to analyze customer preferences and predict fashion trends. the company pairs ai technology with human stylists who review the recommendations and make the final selection ensuring that the personal touch is not lost. american express uses ai to identify customer spending patterns and detect fraudulent transactions. by combining ai with human oversight the company maintains its commitment to exceptional customer service and security. these examples show how companies can leverage ai to make humans even better creativity ai can help by taking over routine tasks speeding up the concept process and freeing up time for us to explore our creative potential and innovation even further. empathy and emotional intelligence ai can support our empathetic nature by providing insights into consumer behavior leading to improved customer experiences and stronger relationships. problem solving and critical thinking ai can support our decision making processes by providing data driven insights that support us in thinking critically and solving the most complex problems. adaptability and learning ai can enhance our learning capabilities accelerating our personal and professional growth. collaboration and teamwork ai can support and enhance collaboration helping us achieve higher levels of efficiency and productivity while maintaining the human touch that drives successful teamwork. its that last point where i believe ai can have the greatest impactand already is. at stitch fix for example large language models help create consumer facing product descriptions which are then tested by the merchandising team. the result is a more effective team working with detailed content and aggregated consumer behavior data to better surface what customers are looking for. meanwhile at amex the growing use of aiand the now data scientists working for the companyhas resulted in the democratization of data placing new tools in the hands of the companys leaders to help them with day to day decision making. how to encourage employees to use ai fostering a culture of innovation and growth is vital for businesses looking to successfully integrate ai. by encouraging employees to develop their skills and understanding of aiby attending events webinars and workshops to startyou can create a supportive environment that embraces not only change and innovation but also continuous learning. even better bring ai training in house and create opportunities for collaboration and skill building. consider establishing partnerships with educational institutions or online learning platforms to offer specialized ai programs for your teams and your industry. by allowing your employees to experiment and practice with ais powerful tools youll be able to apply their newfound knowledge to real world scenariosand for your clientsin no time. importantly however even as your teams comfort and capabilities grow it will be essential to address ethical considerations and brand perception when implementing ai. make sure that its use aligns with your brand by defining clear ethical guidelines that reflect your values and principles. these guidelines should outline how ai will be used what data will be collected and analyzed and how decisions will be made based on ai insights. even so tracking auditing and communicating the impact of ai in areas such as privacy data security fairness and bias must be continuous. like any powerful marketing or research tool ai requires transparency and accountability. always be responsive to concerns raised by employees customers or the public and take appropriate actions to address them. integrating ai and authenticity overcoming the shame surrounding ai use requires a shift in mindset and a focus on the unique partnership between humans and machines. by concentrating on the essential qualities that make us human and leveraging ai to augment those strengths we can create a future where humans and ai work together harmoniously. businesses that successfully integrate ai into their operations while maintaining their authenticity will be better positioned to capitalize on the immense potential of this transformative technology. with this approach embracing ai is not about diminishing our humanity but elevating it to new heights. as an example of this human ai collaboration i am not ashamed to say that i asked chatgpt to proofread this article demonstrating how it can support us in our professional endeavors.

      "in this articlegooglgoogfollow your favorite stockscreate free account google ceo sundar pichai speaks during the google io keynote session at shoreline amphitheatre in mountain view california may. josh edelson afp googles mixed messaging when it comes to its return to office plans has been a subject of consternation across the company since the waning days of the covid pandemic. now employees are finding further sources of frustration. last week google updated its hybrid three day a week office policy to include badge tracking and noted attendance will be included in performance reviews. additionally employees who already received approval for remote work may now have that status reevaluated. based on cnbcs discussions with some employees and posts to an internal site called memegen google faces growing concern among staffers that management is overreaching in its oversight of physical attendance. staffers say theyre being treated like schoolchildren. theres also increased uncertainty about what the future holds for people who moved to different cities and states after they were cleared to work from remote locations. if you cannot attend the office today your parents should submit an absence request reads one top rated meme posted by an employee and viewed by. attached was a photoshopped image of human resources head fiona cicconi in front of a school chalkboard. another highly rated meme said check my work not my badge. ryan lamont a google spokesperson said in an email that the badge data collected is aggregated for company leaders. now that weve fully transitioned to the hybrid work week company leaders can see reports showing how their teams are adopting the hybrid work model the statement said adding google doesnt share individual googler badge data in its reports. an internal document indicates how group leaders will learn who hasnt been in the office frequently enough. managers of non remote googlers who have been consistently absent from the office will be cced on emails to these googlers subject to local requirements so they can support googlers in either ramping back to the office or exploring other flexibility options the document says. on friday youtube held its own all hands meeting with employees about the office policy update. at the event executives presented the plans virtually a paradox that didnt go unnoticed. afterward a popular meme showed an image of the big bang theory tv show character leonard hofstadter saying what are you looking at. youve never seen a hypocrite before. discontent surrounding the return to office policies represents the latest challenge for google as the company tries to get people back into its many expansive offices and campuses across the country. prior to the pandemic google was known for its vibrant campus life replete with massage parlors yoga classes video games and free gourmet meals. but life changed as did priorities during the pandemic when offices were closed and employees were forced to work from home. staffers moved to different cities and got used to more flexibility and family time while taking advantage of googles flexible remote work options. alphabet chief financial officer ruth porat at the world economic forum in davos switzerland may. adam galica cnbctech companies flourished during that stretch. googles revenue growth surged and its stock price rose to record levels. much of that was attributable to a wide array of cloud based collaboration tools that could be used from anywhere. thanks to amazing tools like google workspace we can be highly productive from home particularly when it comes to asynchronous work that requires deep focus cicconi wrote in a memo last week announcing updates to the hybrid policy. in april of last year google began bringing most employees back to physical offices three days a week following several fits and starts in its return to office plans that were complicated by regular spikes in covid infection rates. however with attendance remaining sparse and google looking to cut costs the company started instituting changes this year that havent always been applauded. for example reported in february that googles cloud unit told employees it would transition to a desk sharing workspace in its five largest locations as it downsized real estate. now according to correspondence viewed by the company is in the process of providing lockers in each location that uses the desk sharing model so employees can store personal items overnight. chris schmidt a software engineer at google and a member of the alphabet workers union cwa questioned how the company can work so hard to get people back in the office when desk space is limited. new york city workers do not even have enough desks and conference rooms for workers to use comfortably schmidt said in an email to. google is far from alone among its tech peers in struggling to find the right path with hybrid work. last month thousands of amazon employees walked off the job according to organizers calling on the company to reconsider its three day a week office mandate. an amazon spokesperson estimates that about people participated in the walkout. salesforce is reportedly offering to pay a day to the local charity of choice for every employee that comes back to the office. meta said recently that employees will need to work from a physical office at least three days a week beginning in september. lamont said googles three day policy has been in place for over a year and is now being updated. its going well and we want to see googlers connecting and collaborating in person so were limiting remote work to exception only lamont said. watch war on remote workwatch nowvideo war on remote work google clamps down on

      "houses pictured on th june in halifax united kingdom. uk borrowers are facing sharply higher mortgage costs. mike kemp in pictures london uk borrowers are facing a cliff edge that could damage the economy as rising mortgage costs hit deal renewals and the number of products available shrinks experts warned monday. new figures from financial information company moneyfacts showed the average two year fixed rate mortgage on a residential property in britain rose from friday to its highest level since dec. the spike in late came in the wake of the governments market rattling mini budget. prior to this moneyfacts said two year fixed rates were last above in november. the number of residential mortgage products available has also fallen from on may to. martin stewart director of mortgage advisory london money said the last nine months had been seismic for the mortgage and housing sector on a par with the financial crisis although with different causes. the market is dysfunctional and arguably broken. we have seen evidence where advisers are in queues alongside others all trying to secure something that might not actually exist by the time they get to the front of the queue stewart told. pretty much everything is starting with a now for context two years ago everything started with a or lower. the average rate for a five year mortgage is currently according to moneyfacts. asked about support for struggling households prime minister rishi sunak on monday told itvs good morning britain program that the governments priority was halving inflation and it needed to stick to the plan. watch nowvideo expect more interest rate hikes in the uk goldman sachs sayssquawk box europebanks including hsbc and santander have temporarily pulled mortgage products in recent weeks amid market uncertainty. it comes as short term uk government bond yields climb with the year yield hitting a fresh year high monday. markets are pricing in peak interest rates of almost up from the current. a strong labor market report on june sent rate expectations higher with the bank of england set to announce its latest interest rate decision on thursday after enacting its th consecutive hike in mayuk inflation meanwhile remains among the highest of all developed economies at with central bank officials warning that second round effects including price setting and higher wages could keep it higher for longer. i think the worst of the mortgage crunch is ahead of us said viraj patel senior strategist at vanda research. he noted that more than of households are still to remortgage at higher rates and this will add stress to the housing market and wider economy. patel said he expected the bulk of the consumer slowdown coming from higher mortgage costs to hit home in the second half of. the boe and markets need to be aware of the long and variable lags of monetary policy with the effects of past rate hikes still yet to fully work its way through he told. the uks financial conduct authority in january warned more than households were at risk of default as rates rise. patel said he believed there was a genuine risk of defaults. but its remembering the boe have much better oversight. im worried more about the second round effects consumers spending less and perhaps over extending in non housing credit he added. london moneys martin stewart said borrowers were approaching advisers up to a year earlier than they normally would with attitudes ranging from despair to pragmatism. we are now in the unenviable position of staring over the abyss where the bodies of the over leveraged under saved landlords renters and owners of discretionary spend businesses are beginning to pile up he said. while forecasts for the uk economy have turned more positive in recent months stewart said he expected the personal finance decisions made by so many borrowers to have a macro impact. many borrowers are telling us that they will need to give something up in order to accommodate their new higher payment he said. unfortunately that is how recessions start. cnbcs ganesh rao contributed to this report \n",

      "filed under investigations into donald trump politics donald trump trumps next indictment is looming and the evidence against him is trickling out a tape of trump. his lawyers voice memo. a pool flood. what else does special counsel jack smith know about. by updated jun am edt share this story share this on facebook share this on twitter share all sharing options share all sharing options for trumps next indictment is looming and the evidence against him is trickling out reddit pocket flipboard email former president donald trump watches from a box on the th green during day one of the liv golf invitational at trump national golf club on may in sterling virginia. rob carrgetty is a senior politics correspondent at covering the white house elections and political scandals and investigations. hes worked at since the sites launch in and before that he worked as a research assistant at the new yorkers washington dc bureau. the media is on trump indictment watch again. multiple reports indicate that special counsel jack smiths investigation of trump for the classified documents held at mar a lago is wrapping up and some experts expect an indictment of trump as soon as this week. on wednesday multiple news outlets reported that investigators had recently told trumps legal team he was a target in the documents investigation. the washington post also reported that prosecutors were planning to bring a significant portion of any charges in federal court in south florida rather than in washington dc where the investigation has been headquartered. if trump is charged in the documents probe it would be his first federal indictment but potentially not his last. hes already facing charges from state prosecutors in new york and there are two other investigations pending into whether he tried to unlawfully subvert the result of the election one federal probe and one in georgia. but the documents probe which first broke into public view when the fbi searched mar a lago last august is the one thats apparently coming to a head now. related what is an indictment anyway. understand the trump classified documents case whats in the unsealed indictment against trump. what are the charges against trump and can he go to jail. how are republicans reacting. not well. can trump still run for president after being indicted. what are the other investigations into trump. and as it does a series of stories have leaked out with new revelations about evidence smith has obtained. last week cnn reported that smith had a tape in which trump claimed to have a classified document related to iran in his possession. this weekend the new york times revealed smith had obtained a detailed voice memo from a key period in which a trump attorney recounted the teams private deliberations. and on monday another cnn report revealed that prosecutors had suspicions about a pool draining at mar a lago that flooded a room with servers for the propertys surveillance footage. though trumps team has asserted these leaks come from the special counsel that seems unlikely given how these stories are written they all cite what smiths team has asked grand jury witnesses about but seem to be lacking a fuller picture of his theory of the case. that piecemeal aspect suggests that grand jury witnesses their attorneys and trumps own attorneys may be the sources as theyre trying to piece together what smith has. the key fact at the center of the case is clear enough trump had classified documents at mar a lago at the time of that search that were the property of the us government and that had not been returned to the government despite requests and subpoenas. but many of the bigger questions remain mysterious why did trump keep the documents. what happened to the documents while he had them. whats the evidence that he knew he was breaking the law. and did he knowingly try to deceive the government about whether he still had classified material something that could open him up to an obstruction of justice charge. related will trumps indictment help or hurt his campaign. whatever the answers all signs are currently pointing toward a federal indictment of a former president. prosecutors have a recording in which trump discussed a document about iran if prosecutors charge trump prosecutors will be looking to tell a larger story about why they believe what he did with the documents was so nefarious. thats particularly important because both joe biden and mike pence also ended up with classified documents in their respective homes after leaving the vice presidency. pences investigation was closed without charges and there hasnt been much news of late on the biden investigation being carried out by a separate special counsel robert hur. how was trumps conduct worse. thats where one newly revealed piece of evidence comes in. cnn learned that in the summer of trump had a discussion with people working on a memoir for his former chief of staff mark meadows a discussion that was taped by one of trumps aides. on the tape per cnn trump objected to recent media claims that general mark milley his joint chiefs of staff chair stopped him from attacking iran in his final months in office. trump argued that milley was the one urging him to attack iran and claimed to have a document with milleys own plan to that effect but that he couldnt show it to others. thats significant for a few reasons because its trump claiming to have a specific document and because he acknowledges hes not allowed to show it. trumps allies have floated a dubious defense that he had already used his presidential powers to declassify all the documents in question but his comment on the tape could be interpreted to suggest otherwise. and apparently trumps claim to have this document was not just hot air the new york times has reported that the document does exist though wasnt actually milleys plan since it predated his tenure. the lawyers voice memo and the mar a lago pool flood are relevant to an obstruction charge moving on in the timeline prosecutors also want to trace whether trump lied to government officials when they demanded he return documents. during a months long back and forth with the government trump eventually returned boxes of documents some of which were marked classified. he then was subpoenaed again because officials doubted hed returned everything. related can trump still run for president after being indicted. in june doj investigators visited mar a lago to talk with trumps attorneys who handed over another documents but claimed that was the end of it trump had no more. they also showed investigators a storage room which they said only had non classified records. the latest leaks flesh out two intriguing threads from this period. one involves trumps attorney evan corcoran who during that june visit gave investigators a letter claiming mar a lago had been diligently searched and all remaining classified records had been returned. as later revealed in the fbis search this was not true and more than documents remained on the property including in a basement and in trumps own office. so how did the false letter get put together. smith wanted to find out and a judge ruled this year that corcoran had to testify and hand over documents holding that attorney client privilege doesnt apply here because of the crime fraud exemption that there was evidence the attorney was used by the client to commit a crime. last weekends times report revealed one thing corcoran handed over a lengthy voice memo in which during a long drive hed recapped to himself his interactions with trumps team during this period. per the times sources corcoran said trump had asked him if he had to comply with the subpoena and corcoran responded that he did. corcoran also said that mar a lago employees had told him everything he needed was in the storage room not elsewhere on the property. an earlier report from the guardian claimed corcoran had told others that trump aides had waved him off from searching elsewhere on the property. related biden now has his own classified documents problem. heres how it compares to trumps. so were those trump aides actively conspiring to hide certain documents from trumps own attorneys. many previous reports have described prosecutors intense interest in surveillance footage of the storage room which reportedly shows trump aides moving boxes out of it around the time of investigators visit. other recent reports have described new testimony from low level mar a lago workers and refer to an insider witness. that brings us to monday nights cnn leak which claims that prosecutors had suspicions about an october pool flood at mar a lago in which water got into a room with servers for the surveillance videos. per cnn one witness testified that no footage was actually lost but prosecutors had questions about whether there was a deliberate effort to hold back subpoenaed surveillance footage from the government. does jack smith think there was a conspiracy to hold back classified documents and evidence from the government. if so does he have evidence trump ordered it. he appears to be seriously delving into both topics but we dont yet know what he has concluded. update june am et this story was originally published on june and has been updated to note new reporting about the investigation. will you support voxs explanatory journalism. most news outlets make their money through advertising or

      "Title: The “edgy” sex at the center of HBO’s The Idol is the least interesting part\n",
      "filed under culture tv hbos the idol should just be funny the edgy sex at the center of the idol is the least interesting part of the show. by jun pm edt share this story share this on facebook share this on twitter share all sharing options share all sharing options for hbos the idol should just be funny reddit pocket flipboard email lily rose depp in hbos the idol. eddy chenhbo is a senior correspondent who explains what society obsesses over from marvel and movies to fitness and skin care. he came to in. prior to that he worked at the atlantic. there was a time before porn was widely available on the internet when horny teenage boys had to be resourceful. stealing playboys and penthouses from older siblings ruining their eyesight watching scrambled discolored wavy boobs on the spice channel mentally cataloging which r rated movies had nudity staying up past midnight and tuning into cinemax after dark. watching the idol which premiered on hbo this month its easy to believe these virgin gremlins are exactly who created the hour long drama. officially sam levinson euphoria malcolm marie abel tesfaye aka the singer the weeknd and nightlife entrepreneur reza fahim are behind this supposedly prestige drama about the jagged gory bits of stardom. the show premiered two episodes at the cannes film festival which added to its edgy reputation while tesfayes involvement invites a meta narrative as he himself is a pop star who has visually and musically tried to break and reinvent his image multiple times. the three however have been criticized for not creating a show with something specific to say about idol worship or how simultaneously valuable and worthless fame can be so much as a nipple forward soft core porn series that thinks itself too serious to be called that. given the handful of shallowly written episodes weve seen so far the idol is actually both shows at once. underneath its desperate pulsating virgin horniness is a canny bleak comedy about the nefarious people in a pop stars orbit the people whose talent is to manage support create and make money off the actual talent. theyre vampires who walk in the bel air sun horrendously greedy and relentlessly disappointed. thats a far better show and one that frustratingly the idol seems less interested in being. the idol is phantom of the opera but with more boobs even though she possesses a name thats destined for an office job the swarm of publicists and managers and live nation promoters who orbit jocelyn lily rose depp tell us that she is the brightest star in the music universe even as shes coming back to music after a mental breakdown and the death of her mother. jocelyns team has orchestrated a sexy single called world class sinner that they hope and jocelyn hopes will affirm the return of pop musics bad girl princess. though she and her team both crave success they have disparate views of what that looks like. jocelyn wants to be an artist that resembles something closer to her true self. her team wants jocelyn to sell records. being bad in pop music of course is very different from real life villainy its almost always expressed in sexual naughtiness. no one can really be that bad or that wild if theyre in the business of selling music to millions of consumers. levinson and tesfaye drive this home with jocelyns painfully innocuous single which tesfaye co wrote. im a good girl gone bad jocelyn purrs. get in the car drive fast get on the road and take off my clothes. the weeknd and lily rose depp in the idol. eddy chenhbo even jocelyn admits to the hollowness of her song. she wonders to her best friend slash personal assistant leia rachel sennott if the whole thing is cheesy. what jocelyn wants is to be badder badder than this song and what the people around her will tolerate. jocelyn smokes cigarettes. jocelyn has sex. jocelyn takes nudes one of which goes viral in the first episode. jocelyn also seems to enjoy having her nipples out facing the world. this isnt brilliant writing but it is alas what were given. good girls would also never go to a club and have a one night stand with a rat tailed dude named tedros tesfaye. but jocelyn does. jocelyn has never met a man like tedros before because usually men with rat tails arent as confident and i guess they usually arent as knowledgeable about music. the club owner even has a line about princes pop music genius which seems absolutely profound to jocelyn and exponentially less profound to anyone not jocelyn. the whole tale is a hornier version of the phantom of the opera the andrew lloyd webber spectacular about an ingenue named christine who becomes a star singer under the tutelage of a guy whos literally an underground producer. lloyd webbers gothic extravaganza explores the idea of psychosexual obsession perversion and darkness as part of an artistic seduction. the phantom wants christine for himself manipulating her with each visit much to the ire of her high society circle. tedros phantom. jocelyn christine. but instead of teaching her how to become a better singer by crooning at her tedros introduces her to what levinson and tesfaye want you to believe is kinky sex. the illicitness of the sex jocelyn is having with tedros according to the shows logic unlocks a better understanding of jocelyns own identity. in whats been dubbed the worst sex scene of all time tedros blindfolds jocelyn and proceeds to bark commands at her sentences peppered with phrases like suffocate you with my cock. this scene is scored with a swooning sax solo ooo ooo ing up and down octaves. meanwhile tedross acquaintance and acolyte its hinted that tedros is running a cult chloe suzanna son secretly watches and fondles herself. according to the closed captioning jocelyn gagging sounds are also woven in. levinson and tesfaye have been adamant in the press surrounding the idol that the show is purposely edgy and controversial and is somehow pushing the boundaries of sex and nudity on tv. theres even a moment in the first episode that makes an intimacy coordinator the butt of a joke. in an interview about this specific sex scene tesfaye slightly walked that notion back asserting that the sex scene was supposed to be cringey and purposely bad. it was supposed to cause discomfort he claimed. tesfayes about face feels like a pivot in response to the critiques waving away the failure to thrill as purposeful camp instead of an intentionally kinky sex scene. it feels neither kinky nor campy but rather like it was conceived by someone whos only ever had awful sex. the most fascinating parts of the show have nothing to do with sex tedross bad romance threatens everything jocelyn has worked for and by extension everyone that works for jocelyn. jocelyn is yes a person but she represents far more than that. shes a multimillion dollar brand that has been carefully created cultivated marketed and strategized to maximize album sales song streams and concert revenue. every move jocelyn makes is closely watched by her assistant a creative director a manager another manager a publicist and a record label executive. examining this dynamic through satire and blistering comedy is where the show actually gets clever. at the top of jocelyn inc. tm is nikki katz jane adams the monstrously cynical record label executive in charge of jocelyns new album. one moment shes explaining how mental illness is that little push that makes unattainable women sexier to the sort of people who live in flyover states and the next she tells a vanity fair reporter hari nef that mental health is truly so important and that jocelyn is prioritizing hers like that black girl in the olympics. jane adams is the best thing about the idol. its a shame the show doesnt think so. eddy chenhbo nikkis presence raises a bigger question what if jocelyn is just clever marketing. what if the biggest pop star on the planet is only the biggest pop star on the planet because a bunch of ghoulish people in a room decided years ago that her waist to hip proportion the symmetry of her face and the tone of her voice though the only voice the audience hears is lip synced and auto tuned fit some kind of golden ratio. with nikki and the rest of jocelyns entourage the idol shrugs off its uber serious tone for a comedic one. adams who just about slithers away with the entire show delivers nikkis cruel lines with a whisper of humor sliding into absurdity which ultimately allows the show to really tap into something sinister. she doesnt care who jocelyn is nor does she see her as a person. jocelyn exists to pay the bills. when jocelyn no longer sells out arenas jocelyn no longer exists. its possible for someone as awful as nikki to elicit laughs because the reality that the music industry is actually full of nikkis ready to run their wards into the ground is scarier than tedros and his chatgpt sexual commands. sennotts performance as leia also leans into the idea of pop star as farce. jocelyn is housing leia in a mansion and paying her to do menial tasks like open the curtains in her room and make her coffee. despite being jocelyns bestie shes just as much an instrument of the management team always saying yes and always telling jocelyn shes great. leias only input in the first episode is explaining that the taxonomy of bukkake is the presence of multiple men. like the rest of them leia depends on jocelyns success for her livelihood. if jocelyn really cant trust her best friend to be honest with her theres really no one she can trust. the idol wants to be about the ways a pop star breaks not to mention the way pretty perfect pop princesses have always been an illusion. beneath the scrim of glamour its a world of monsters. thats not a bad idea given the way society is re examining how we treated britney and christina and how we still might be treating the likes of taylor swift ariana grande and selena gomez. the problem is that the idol is deeply infatuated with using serious kinky shocking. sex as a shorthand for rebellion and its own depth. that along with tefayes corny performance becomes its undoing. each time the idol delves into how provocative sex and light cultism unlocks jocelyns artistic side or rather what she thinks artistry is levinsons and tesfayes storytelling gets in its own way squandering any kind of emotional impact. the better scarier version of the idol is on a parallel track with the one its giving us a bleak comedy about a pop star who might not be that talented sexy or artistic but can be engineered to appear to be all of those things. the manager strategizing how to parlay mental illness into album sales is far more sinister than the creep and his creepy sex. its a shame that the idol is so much more interested in the latter. will you support voxs explanatory journalism. most news outlets make their money through advertising or subscriptions. but when it comes to what were trying
